<h2 class="b1"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page009" name="page009"></a>(p. 009)</span> WHAT THE WAR MEANS TO AMERICA<br>

<span class="smaller smcap">By MAJOR GENERAL LEONARD WOOD, U. S. A.</span></h2>

<p class="quote">
     "Go yourselves, every man of you, and stand in the ranks and
     either a victory beyond all victories in its glory awaits you, or
     falling you shall fall greatly, and worthy of your
     past."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Demosthenes To the Athenians.</span></p>


<p class="p2">What lesson will America draw from the present Great War? Must she see
the heads of her own children at the foot of the guillotine to realize
that it will cut, or will she accept the evidence of the thousands which
have lain there before? Will she heed the lesson of all time, that
national unpreparedness means national downfall, or will she profit from
the experience and misfortunes of others and take those needed measures
of preparedness which prudence and wisdom dictate. In a word, will she
draw any valuable lessons from the Great War? This is the question which
is so often asked. As yet there is no answer.</p>

<p>It is the question uppermost in the minds of all those who are
intelligently interested in our country's welfare and safety. It is the
question which vitally concerns all of us, as it concerns the defense
and possibly the very existence of our nation. The answer must be
"Preparedness." If we are to live, preparedness to oppose the force of
wrong with the strength of right. Will it be? That's the question! Or
will America drift on blind to the lessons of the world tragedy,
heedless of consequences, concerned with the accumulation of wealth,
satiated with a sense of moral worth which the world does not so fully
recognize, planning to capture the commerce of the warring nations, and
expecting at the same time to retain their friendship and regard. Let us
hope that, in the light of what is, and as a preparation against what
may be, the answer will be characteristic of a great people, peaceful
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page010" name="page010"></a>(p. 010)</span> but prudent and foreseeing; that it will be thorough,
carefully thought-out preparedness; preparedness against war. A
preparedness which if it is to be lasting and secure must be founded
upon the moral organization of our people; an organization which will
create and keep alive in the heart of every citizen a sense not only of
obligation for service to the nation in time of war or trouble, but also
of obligation to so prepare himself as to render this service effective.
An organization which will recognize that the basic principle upon which
a free democracy or representative government rests, and must rest, if
they are to survive the day of stress and trouble, is, that with manhood
suffrage goes manhood obligation for service, not necessarily with arms
in hand, but for service somewhere in that great complex mass which
constitutes the organization of a nation's might and resources for
defense; organization which will make us think in terms of the nation
and not those of city, State, or personal interest; organization which
will result in all performing service for the nation with singleness of
purpose in a common cause&mdash;preparedness for defense: preparedness to
discharge our plain duty whatever it may be. Such service will make for
national solidarity, the doing away with petty distinctions of class and
creed, and fuse the various elements of this people into one homogeneous
mass of real Americans, and leave us a better and a stronger people.</p>

<p>Once such a moral organization is accomplished, the remaining
organization will be simple. This will include an organization of
transportation, on land and sea, and of communications. An organization
of the nation's industrial resources so that the energy of its great
manufacturing plants may be promptly turned into making what they can
best make to supply the military needs of the nation. By military needs
we mean all the complex requirements of a nation engaged in war,
requirements which are, many of them, requirements of peace as well as
of war. It will also include a thorough organization of the country's
chemical resources and the development thereof, so that we may be as
little dependent as possible upon materials from oversea. At present
many important and essential elements come from oversea <span class="pagenum"><a id="page011" name="page011"></a>(p. 011)</span>
nations and would not be available in case of loss of sea control. We
must devise substitutes or find means of making these things. Chemistry
is one of the great weapons of modern war. There must also be
organization which will provide a regular army organized on sound lines,
supplied with ample reserves of men and material; an army adequate to
the peace needs of the nation, which means, among other things, the
secure garrisoning of our oversea possessions, including the Philippines
and the Hawaiian Islands. These latter are the key to the Pacific, and
one of the main defenses of the Pacific Coast and of the Panama Canal.
Whoever holds these islands will dominate the trade routes of the
Pacific, and in a large measure the Pacific itself.</p>

<p>The regular army should also be sufficient for the secure holding and
safeguarding of the Panama Canal, an instrument of war of the greatest
importance, so long as it is in our control, greatly increasing the
value of our navy, and an implement of commerce of tremendous value, a
possession so valuable and of such vital importance to us that we cannot
allow it to lie outside our secure grasp.</p>

<p>It must also be adequate to provide garrisons in Porto Rico and Alaska,
and at the same time maintain in the continental United States a force
of coast artillery sufficient to furnish the necessary manning details
for our seacoast defenses, and a mobile force complete in every detail
and adequate in time of war to meet the first shock of an invasion and
sufficient in time of peace to meet the various demands made upon it for
home service, such as troops for home emergencies or disorders, troops
for the necessary training of the National Militia, also sufficient
officers and noncommissioned officers for duty at schools, colleges,
military training camps and in various other capacities. It must be also
strong enough to provide a strong expeditionary force, such as we sent
to Cuba in 1898, without interfering with its regular duties.</p>

<p>The necessity of building and maintaining an adequate navy, well
balanced, thoroughly equipped and maintained at the highest standard of
efficiency and ready always for immediate service, with necessary
adjuncts afloat and ashore, is also one of the clear <span class="pagenum"><a id="page012" name="page012"></a>(p. 012)</span> lessons
of the war; others are the establishment of ammunition plants at points
sufficiently remote from the seacoast, and so placed as to render their
capture and destruction improbable in case of sudden invasion; the
provision of an adequate reserve corps of 50,000 officers, a number
sufficient for one and one-half million of citizen soldiers; officers
well trained and ready for immediate service; the provision of adequate
supplies and reserve supplies of artillery, arms, and ammunition of all
types for these troops.</p>

<p>We must also build up a system under which officers and men for our
citizen soldiery can be trained with the minimum of interference with
their educational or industrial careers, under conditions which will
permit the accomplishment of their training during the period of youth,
and once this is accomplished will permit their return to their normal
occupations with the minimum of delay.</p>

<p>The lesson which we should draw from the Great War is that nothing
should be left to chance or to the promise of others, or to the
fair-weather relations of to-day; that we should be as well prepared,
and as well organized on land as Switzerland, a nation without a trace
of militarism, and yet so thoroughly prepared and so thoroughly ready
and able to defend herself that to-day her territory is inviolate,
although she is surrounded by warring nations.</p>

<p>Belgium to-day is an illustration of what may be expected from lack of
adequate preparedness.</p>

<p>The great outstanding lesson of the war is that we must not trust to
righteousness and fair dealing alone; we must be prepared to play our
part, and while loving justice and dealing fairly with others, we must
be always ready to do our full duty, and to defend our country with
force if need be. If we do not, we shall always be helpless and at the
mercy of our enemies. We can be strong, yet tolerant, just, yet prepared
to defend ourselves against aggression.</p>

<p>Another lesson is that our military establishment on land and sea should
not be dependent upon a system of militia and volunteers. These will not
be found adequate under the conditions of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page013" name="page013"></a>(p. 013)</span> modern war, and
above all we should appreciate the fact that our military system must be
founded upon <i>equality of service, rich and poor alike</i>. We must while
extending equality of privilege to all, including the thousands who are
coming to us every day, insist upon equality of obligation by all. With
the privileges of citizenship must go the obligations and
responsibilities not only in peace but also in war.</p>

<p>We should take heed of the lessons of the past, and remember that the
volunteer system has always failed us in our wars. Such experience as we
have had in war in recent years has in no way prepared us for a war with
a first-class nation prepared for war. We have never engaged in such a
war unaided. This experience is one which is still before us. We should
look upon service for the nation in the same way as we look upon the
payment of taxes, or the compliance with the thousand and one laws and
regulations which govern our everyday life.</p>

<p>Relatively few people would voluntarily pay taxes even though they knew
the money was to go to the best of purposes. They pay taxes because the
law requires it. The people as a whole cannot be expected, nor can we
with safety trust to their performing their military duties effectively,
unless some general system of equal service for all who are physically
fit, is prescribed, some system which will insure preparation in advance
of war, some system which will <i>bear upon all alike</i>. The volunteer
spirit is superb, but the volunteer system is not a dependable system to
which to trust the life and security of the people, especially in these
days when the highest degree of organization marks all nations with whom
we may possibly have some day differences which will result in the use
of force. The militia, willing as it is, cannot be depended upon as a
reliable military asset. Its very method of control makes it an
undependable force, and at times unavailable. The men and officers are
not at fault; they have done all that could be expected under a system
which renders efficiency almost impossible of attainment. The militia
must be absolutely and completely transferred to Federal control; it
must cease to be a State and become a Federal force, without any
relationship whatever with the State.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page014" name="page014"></a>(p. 014)</span> The militia must have thoroughly trained reserves sufficient in
number to bring it promptly to war strength. The infantry of the
National Guard, as in the regular army, is maintained on a peace footing
at rather less than half its maximum strength.</p>

<p>For a number of years we have been confronted by conditions which may
involve the use of a considerable force of troops, a force exceeding the
regular army and perhaps even the regular army in conjunction with the
militia. This means that a thousand or more men would have to be added
to each regular and National Guard infantry regiment to bring it to full
strength. In the National Guard only a small proportion of the men have
had long service and thorough training, and if brought to full strength
through the injection of a thousand practically untrained men it would
mean these regiments would go to the front with not over 30 per cent of
well-trained men. In other words, they would be military assemblages of
well-meaning, but undisciplined and untrained individuals, and unless we
are to repeat the experiences of '98 it will be necessary to hold them
for several months in camp and put them through a course of the most
intensive training. It is probable that if they are called it will be
under an emergency which will not permit such training, and we shall see
again the scenes of '98, untrained, willing boys, imperfectly equipped
under inexperienced officers, rushed to the front, willing but a more or
less useless sacrifice.</p>

<p>Another great lesson should be to heed no longer those false prophets
who have been proclaiming that the day of strife has passed, and that
everything is to be settled by arbitration; prophets of the class who
obstructed preparation in England, who decried universal military
training, and all but delivered her into the hands of her enemies.</p>

<h2><span class="pagenum"><a id="page017" name="page017"></a>(p. 017)</span> NAVAL LESSONS OF THE WAR<br>

<span class="smaller smcap">By REAR ADMIRAL AUSTIN M. KNIGHT, U. S. N.</span></h2>


<p>Although the greatest war in history is not yet at an end, and none of
us can even guess when the end will come, it is possible to draw certain
very important conclusions from the developments to date, especially in
so far as these developments are concerned with war upon the sea. The
great sea fight for which the world has looked since its two greatest
naval powers went to war against each other has not taken place. It may
never take place, although both sides profess that they are eager for
it. And until it does take place, the final word will not be spoken as
to the relations between guns and armor, between battleships and battle
cruisers, or between either of these types of "capital" ships on the one
hand, and the destroyer and submarine on the other.</p>

<p>The submarine has proven its power, it is true, and against the
battleship; but always where the element of <i>surprise</i> has entered into
its attack in quite a different fashion from that which is inherent in
its always mysterious and stealthy nature. The battle cruiser has shown
the value of speed and long-range guns combined, but in a comparatively
restricted field. The destroyer has played a part in coast patrol and
has doubtless accounted for a number of submarines; but in its proper
sphere of activity it has accomplished nothing. And the wonderful
achievements of the airship have been practically confined to operations
on land. We have waited vainly and shall continue so to wait for the one
supreme lesson which the war has been expected to yield, unless it
chance that on some day to be forever memorable in the annals of the
world there shall sweep out upon the stormy waters of the North Sea two
fleets complete in every <span class="pagenum"><a id="page018" name="page018"></a>(p. 018)</span> type of craft that human ingenuity
has thus far contrived, to engage in a struggle to the death&mdash;a struggle
by which the issue of the war may be decided in an hour, and in a
fashion incomparably more dramatic than anything which the warfare on
land, with all its horrors, has presented or by any possibility can
present.</p>

<p>Pending this one great lesson, what is it that the war has taught?</p>

<p>First of all, it has taught once more the old, old lesson that has been
taught by practically every war in which sea power has been a factor,
that where this element is a factor, it is a factor of decisive
importance. The British navy may not win the war for England, but it is
every day more apparent that if the British navy did not exist, or if it
dominated the sea less decisively than it does, the cause for which
England stands would be a lost cause. And the extraordinary feature of
the situation is that the navy is accomplishing its mission by merely
existing. Thus far the "Grand Fleet" has not struck a blow. From its
position on the English coast it looks across to the mouth of the Kiel
Canal, and&mdash;waits! Its patrols are always on guard, the coasts which it
defends are never threatened, and the commerce which trusts to its
protection comes and goes with practically no thought of danger. For
several months during the submarine campaign against commerce, something
like one-half of one per cent of the merchant vessels bound to and from
the ports of England were sunk. But no industry was crippled for a
moment, and neither the necessities nor the luxuries of life were
appreciably curtailed. Even at the height of the submarine operations,
great transports loaded with troops crossed the English Channel freely,
and out of a million and a half of soldiers so transported not a single
one was lost. It is safe to say that in any three months since the war
began the British navy has repaid the cost of its maintenance for a
century in pounds, shillings, and pence; and in the sense of security
which its existence and efficiency have imparted to the English people,
the return upon the investment has been beyond all calculation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page019" name="page019"></a>(p. 019)</span> The first and greatest lesson of the war, then, is this&mdash;that
the value of an effective navy, when the time comes for it to manifest
its effectiveness, is out of all proportion to the sums, vast though
these may be, that it has cost; that if it overmatches the opposing navy
decisively enough, the country behind it may rest secure and serenely
indifferent to the thought of invasion or even of attack, so far as its
sea frontier is concerned; and that the navy&mdash;still assuming it to be of
commanding strength&mdash;may accomplish its whole mission of defense without
ever being called upon to strike a blow.</p>

<p>It can hardly be necessary to point out the fact that this lesson may be
read in terms of "preparedness." The British navy was prepared when the
war began; the British army was not. The German army was prepared; the
German navy was not&mdash;in the sense of being large enough for its mission.
With these facts in mind, we have only to look at the contrast between
the progress of the war on land and that on the sea to read the whole
lesson of preparedness in a form so concrete that it is hard to
understand how any observer can fail to grasp its full significance.</p>

<p>Among the minor lessons of the war, it will probably appear to most
laymen that the unforeseen effectiveness of the submarine is the most
significant. In a way this is true; but the significance of the lesson
may be dangerously exaggerated unless we recognize the part contributed
to the early successes of the submarine by the element of surprise to
which allusion has already been made. When the war began, the submarine
was an untried and an almost unknown weapon, and the British navy was
rather contemptuous of it, or at least indifferent toward it. Its
dramatic appearance in the North Sea at early dawn of a misty September
morning was as great a surprise to the three British cruisers which it
sank in rapid succession as the story of the disaster was to the world
at large. The fact that the cruisers by their carelessness invited the
fate which came to them does not, of course, deprive the incident of
significance. But after all, the world has never doubted that a
submarine could sink a ship that practically insisted upon being sunk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page020" name="page020"></a>(p. 020)</span> As a result of this experience, British men-of-war operating
thereafter in what they considered submarine territory, took reasonable
precautions; and in such waters no other important successes have been
scored against them. But neither to them nor, probably, to anyone else
except their adversaries, did it occur that a submarine could make its
way from the North Sea to the Dardanelles. And so it came about that
when one of them appeared there, it found conditions again ideal for
surprise, and taking advantage of these conditions delivered its attack
and scored a success as striking as the earlier one in its own home
waters.</p>

<p>The activities of submarines against merchant shipping we need not
discuss here. The only lesson they hold for us, from the point of view
of naval warfare, is the lesson that for them, as for all other
activities of the submarine, there is an answer. The answer was not
ready when the war began, but it was not long delayed. We are apt to
think of the submarine as if it always operated under water, and
completely under water. But when it is completely under water, it is
completely blind and as helpless as other blind things are. To see
objects at a distance, it must be on the surface, and to see them even
close at hand it must at least expose its periscope. Having definitely
located an object within easy range, it may wholly submerge and deliver
its torpedo without seeing the target. But the chance of a hit under
these conditions is remote. Normally the submarine remains on the
surface until it sights an enemy. Having approached as close as seems
practicable without danger of being seen itself, it submerges, <i>except
for the periscope</i>, and approaches within range, directing its course
and its aim, <i>by sight</i>&mdash;not by some occult instinct such as is often
attributed to it. When within a zone where imminent danger threatens, it
may remain wholly submerged for a long period of time, but when so
submerged, it is not in any degree a threat to other craft.</p>

<p>In other words, the submarine is dangerous only when it can see. And
when it can see, it can be seen&mdash;not easily perhaps, but certainly by an
observer reasonably close at hand and on the lookout. It is especially
liable to detection from an airship. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page021" name="page021"></a>(p. 021)</span> Moreover, the noise of
its propellers can be heard at a considerable distance, and a very
sensitive microphone has been developed as a submarine detector. The
waters about Great Britain are now patrolled by hundreds of small, fast
craft&mdash;destroyers, trawlers, motor boats&mdash;always on the lookout for a
periscope or other indication of the proximity of a submarine. If one is
actually seen, its capture or destruction follows as a matter of course.
If the presence of one is indicated by the microphone or other evidence,
such as oil floating on the water, or bubbles rising to the surface,
nets are lowered and the water dragged for miles around. It is not known
how many submarines have been destroyed by these tactics, but the number
is unquestionably large. Thus the submarine is being robbed of much of
its mystery and much of its terror, and while it remains, and will
always remain, a danger, the lesson of the war is that it must take its
place beside other dangers with which modern war is filled, as something
to be respected and feared, but not as having rendered the battleship
and battle cruiser obsolete.</p>

<p>Another lesson of the war has resulted from the fact that practically
all of the important operations on the British side have been conducted
by battle cruisers, not by battleships. It is not to be understood from
this that the battleship has been discredited, for such is not the case.
The fleet to which reference has already been made as holding the gates
of the North Sea and "containing" the German fleet behind the
fortifications of Helgoland is made up principally of battleships, and
it is largely because they have been engaged in this important duty that
the few opportunities which the war has offered for active service have
fallen to the lot of battle cruisers. But there are other reasons for
this which spring from the nature of the battle cruiser itself and
inhere in the difference between this type and the battleship. In size
the types are practically identical, and in power of armament the
difference is not great. But the battle cruiser sacrifices much of the
armor by which the battleship is weighted down, and purchases by this
sacrifice a great increase in speed. The typical battleship of to-day
has <span class="pagenum"><a id="page022" name="page022"></a>(p. 022)</span> some 14 inches of armor on the side; the battle cruiser,
from 5 to 9 inches. The battleship has 22 knots speed, the battle
cruiser 32 knots. There has been much discussion as to the relative
merits of the two types, and conservative officers have been slow to
accept the battle cruiser. The war has shown the necessity for both
types, and no better illustration of their relative merits could be
wished than that which is afforded by the spectacle of the battleships
engaged in what is practically a blockade of the German fleet, while the
battle cruisers have swept the German raiders, the <i>Scharnhorst</i>,
<i>Gneisenau</i>, and their consorts, from the distant seas which were the
chosen field of their operations. Following the destruction of Admiral
Cradock's little squadron by the faster and more heavily armed
<i>Scharnhorst</i> and <i>Gneisenau</i>, the British admiralty dispatched a
squadron of battle cruisers to run down the German ships, and in the
battle off the Falkland Islands the history of Coronel was repeated with
a change of sides, the fast and heavily armed battle cruisers under
Admiral Sturdee making short work of the German ships, which they
overmatched in speed and range as decisively as the Germans had
overmatched the ships of Admiral Cradock's squadron at Coronel. In each
case victory went to the ships of high speed and long-range guns, and
these two are the determining characteristics of the battle cruiser. In
the action of January 25, 1915, in the North Sea, the same
characteristics won again. Battle cruisers were engaged on both sides,
but the side which had the advantage in speed and range won the fight.</p>

<p>Thus the battle cruiser had justified itself, and its justification is
one of the striking lessons of the war. We may believe that the lesson
will be emphasized if the time ever comes when this type finds the
opportunity to display its adaptability for work in certain other fields
for which it was originally designed&mdash;in scouting operations, for
example, and in flanking movements in connection with a fleet
engagement.</p>

<p>It does not appear that aeroplanes were used for scouting in any of the
operations in the open sea&mdash;either as preliminary to the battle off
Coronel and the Falklands, or in the search for raiders like the <i>Emden</i>
and the <i>Karlsruhe</i>. They have been used, however, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page023" name="page023"></a>(p. 023)</span> in the
waters about the British Islands, and with such marked success as to
leave no doubt that they would have been of great value in search
operations on a larger scale. They were used also for directing the fire
of ships on the fortifications at the Dardanelles, and the results
indicate that they have an important field of usefulness for directing
the fire of one ship or fleet against another. It is to be expected that
from this time forward, vessels fitted for carrying and launching both
air and water planes will accompany fleets, and it is impossible to
think of a scout to be designed after the lessons of this war, which
will not carry several of them. As the scouts are the eyes of the fleet,
so the aeroplanes will be the eyes of the scouts, extending the scouting
range by several hundred miles and making secrecy of operations at sea
almost as impossible as they have already made it on land.</p>

<p>Allusion has already been made to the use of aeroplanes&mdash;flying not more
than a few hundred feet above the water&mdash;for locating submarines; and it
is not difficult to understand how effective a waterplane would be for
destroying a periscope, or even a submarine itself&mdash;this last, perhaps,
by dropping a bomb.</p>

<p>The lesson of the torpedo is connected with that of the submarine, but
has many features which are individual to itself. It is known that
within a very few years past the range and accuracy of the torpedo have
greatly increased, but there is little evidence connecting these
features with the performance of torpedoes in the present war. So far as
known, the submarines have done most of their effective work at short
ranges where hits were to be expected. And no one will ever know how
many shots have missed. The great outstanding lesson thus far is the
extraordinary destructiveness of the torpedoes that have found their
mark. It would never have been believed two years ago that ships like
the <i>Cressy</i>, <i>Aboukir</i>, and <i>Hogue</i> would turn turtle a few minutes
after a single blow from a torpedo. Still less would it have seemed
possible to sink a <i>Lusitania</i> in fifteen minutes. A torpedo might, of
course, produce an extraordinary effect if it chanced to strike a boiler
compartment or a magazine. But it does not appear that this happened in
any one of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page024" name="page024"></a>(p. 024)</span> many disasters in question. It has been said
that the German torpedoes carry an exceptionally heavy explosive charge,
the extra weight having been gained by a sacrifice in speed and range.
This may in part explain their effectiveness, but when all allowance is
made for what we know or guess along this and similar lines, the fact
remains that the torpedo has shown itself a weapon of vastly greater
destructive power than the world has heretofore attributed to it.</p>

<p>The story of the Dardanelles campaign has illustrated again the futility
of attacking land fortifications by battleships. Attacks of this kind
have never succeeded, and the temptation is strong to accept the theory
that in planning these operations the British anticipated little or no
resistance from those in command of the forts. It was conceivable that
the forts could be passed&mdash;as were those at New Orleans and Mobile Bay
by Farragut&mdash;but not that they could be reduced by the gun fire of
ships. Information is lacking as to the damage actually done. It was
probably greater than the defenders have admitted; but it evidently fell
far short of silencing the forts. If the world needed a new
demonstration of the power of forts to stand out against ships, we may
put this down as one more lesson of the war.</p>

<p>An important revelation of the war is the smoothness and rapidity with
which large bodies of troops, with all their impedimenta&mdash;horses,
artillery, etc.&mdash;have been transported by water. This has, of course,
been possible only for Great Britain and her allies, and for them only
because they have held unchallenged the command of the sea. It is thus,
first of all, a confirmation of the lesson with which this paper
opened&mdash;the lesson that command of the sea is a factor of the very first
importance in any war in which it is a factor at all. It is secondarily
a lesson in the ease with which a nation which has command of the sea
can, in these days of large fast steamers, transport its military forces
in practically unlimited numbers to any distance that may be desired. It
is thus an answer to the protestations of those who insist that the
United States is secured against the danger of invasion by the thousands
of miles of water which separate its coasts from those of possible
enemies; <span class="pagenum"><a id="page025" name="page025"></a>(p. 025)</span> for it demonstrates what has, from the day of the
first Atlantic crossing by a steamship, become more and more notably a
fact&mdash;that the oceans which separate frontiers for certain purposes,
connect them for other purposes and especially for purposes of transit
and transportation. The term "Ocean Highway" is no mere figure of
speech. The millions of troops that have passed by water from England
into France have made the passage with infinitely less difficulty than
has been connected with the further passage by land to the fighting
lines; and the hundreds of thousands from England, France, India, and
Australia, which have assembled in the Near East could not have covered
the distances that they have covered, if they had moved by land, in ten
times the number of days they have occupied in moving by sea. The sea
being clear of enemy ships, the route from Liverpool to the Dardanelles
has been a lane for an easy and pleasant promenade. With the Atlantic
and Pacific controlled by the fleets of nations at war with us, their
waters would invite, rather than impede, the movement of an army to our
shores. It would be difficult to exaggerate the significance of this
lesson for the United States.</p>

<p>A rather grewsome lesson, but one which cannot be ignored, is that in a
naval battle, there are, at the end, neither "wounded", "missing", nor
"prisoners" to be reported. A ship defeated is, and will be, in a great
majority of cases, a ship sunk; and sinking, she will sink with all on
board. Some few exceptions there may be, but the rule can hardly fail to
be as thus stated. One of the first things that a ship does in preparing
for battle is to get rid of her boats; and, as both her companions and
her opponents are sure to do the same, her crew can neither help
themselves nor look for help from friends or enemies. The <i>Good Hope</i>
and the <i>Monmouth</i> went down in the battle off Coronel leaving not a
single survivor to tell the story of their destruction. Following the
battle off the Falkland Islands, the British picked up a few survivors
from the German ships, but not enough to contradict the rule. In the
running engagement in the North Sea on January 25, 1915, the <i>Blücher</i>
went down with 650 out of 900 of her crew. Scarcely a man was saved from
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page026" name="page026"></a>(p. 026)</span> the <i>Cressy</i>, the <i>Aboukir</i>, or the <i>Hogue</i>. And so the story
runs, and so it must always run when modern ships fight in earnest.</p>

<p>One of the most striking features of the engagements up to the present
time is the range at which they have been fought. A few years ago 10,000
yards was considered the extreme range at which ships would open fire.
The ranges used in the Russo-Japanese War varied from 3,000 to 8,000
yards, and the battle off Tsushima was decided at less than 6,000 yards.
In the present war the ranges have been nearly three times as great as
these. In the battle off Coronel, the <i>Good Hope</i> was sunk at 12,000
yards, the <i>Monmouth</i> at a little less. In the battle off the Falkland
Islands, both sides opened fire at 17,000 yards, and the German ships
were sunk at approximately 16,000 yards. The running fight in the North
Sea opened at 18,000 yards, and the <i>Blücher</i> was sunk at 15,000 yards.
This extraordinary increase in the fighting range corresponds in a
measure to an increase in accuracy of fire, but it corresponds also to a
new recognition of the enormous advantage which may result from a
fortunate hit early in the action. The theoretical advantage which
should result from this has been confirmed by practical experience, and
it may be regarded as certain that battle ranges hereafter will conform
more nearly to those off Coronel than to those of Tsushima.</p>

<p>To summarize: The great outstanding naval lesson of the war is this:
That a nation whose navy commands the sea can rest secure, so far as its
sea frontier is concerned, from the fear of invasion or of serious
attack; that, further, its command of the sea insures to its commerce
the freedom of the sea; and that, finally, this freedom extends equally
to its armed forces, to which the highways of the sea are opened wide,
affording a possibility of offense at distant points which is denied to
the forces of the enemy.</p>

<p>Perhaps the lesson second in importance is that, owing to the rapid
march of invention in these days of progress, it is to be expected that
every war which comes suddenly upon the world will come with certain
elements of surprise, some of them startling in their power and
effectiveness, some of them giving promise <span class="pagenum"><a id="page027" name="page027"></a>(p. 027)</span> of much and
accomplishing comparatively little. However surprising and however
effective the best of these may be, they will fall short of
revolutionizing warfare, but they may profoundly modify it; and the
nation which has them ready for use in the beginning will gain an
initial advantage which may go far toward determining the issue of the
war.</p>

<p>Lessons of more limited significance have to do with the effectiveness
of the submarine and the unexpected radius of action of which it has
shown itself capable; the amazing destructive power of the torpedo; the
value of the battle cruiser, both for the defense of a coast from
raiding expeditions, and for operations in distant seas where speed is
needed to bring an enemy to action, and heavy guns to insure his
destruction; the difficulty of reducing shore fortifications by fire
from ships; the necessity of aeroplanes for scouting at sea, and the
modifications in naval strategy and tactics which will result from their
general adoption.</p>

<p>After many months of sparring between the British and German naval
forces in the North Sea, an important engagement took place on May 31,
1916, between the two main fleets. Exactly what forces were engaged will
probably not be known until the end of the war, and it is certain that
we must wait long for definitely reliable reports as to the losses on
the two sides. It is already clear, however, that the encounter has
added little to our knowledge of naval warfare. British battle cruisers
engaged German battleships at close range and were badly punished. In
this there was nothing new or instructive. Nor has anything new or
instructive developed from what is thus far known of other phases of the
battle. Indeed the one and only striking feature of the battle appears
to be the fact that everything occurred practically as it might have
been expected to occur. Neither submarines nor destroyers, neither
Zeppelins nor aeroplanes provided any startling features. The only
lesson thus far apparent is the old one that while dash and audacity
have their place in warfare, they need the directing and steadying hand
of judgment and of skill.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>



<h2 class="b1"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page031" name="page031"></a>(p. 031)</span> THE WORLD'S WAR<br>

<span class="smaller smcap">By FREDERICK PALMER</span></h2>

<p class="title">INITIAL STRATEGY</p>


<p>In innumerable volumes future generations will learn the details of this
war: and the discussions among delving historians will never end. For
our time a simpler task is the service set for us. We require a record
of the essential facts of the struggle arranged with a sense of
historical perspective.</p>

<p>For forty years the great nations of Europe had had universal service.
Every able-bodied youth, unless his government chose to excuse him,
became a soldier. For forty years the diplomatists had held the balance
of power so delicately poised that the mighty armed forces all kept to
their own sides of their frontiers. It was in the era of modern
invention and man's mastery of material power that these great armies
were formed and trained for the war that was to test their steel.</p>

<p>Where Napoleon marched a hundred thousand men along parallel roads, the
modern general sends his millions on railroad trains. The problem for
each nation when war came was to concentrate with a greater rapidity
than its adversary its enormous masses of men and guns against the
enemy; and success in this was not due as in former days to speed of
foot over good highways such as the Romans and Napoleon built, but to
organized railroad and automobile transport or rather the prompt
employment of all the industrial resources of the nation for war alone.</p>

<p>Out of the conflicting reports day by day emerge to the observer as he
reviews the progress of the war, with the map before him, plans of
campaign as simple in their broad lines <span class="pagenum"><a id="page032" name="page032"></a>(p. 032)</span> as in Cæsar's or
Alexander's day. Generals fighting with a million or two million men
under their command have held to the same principles as if they had only
ten or fifteen thousand.</p>

<p>All schools of successful warfare have believed in the offensive; in
quick decisive blows which take the enemy by surprise and find him
unready if possible. They hold that the army in rest must always be
beaten by the army which takes the initiative. This partly explains the
frequent small actions indicated by the reports of trenches taken in
assault along the western front, while the lines occupied by the armies
did not radically change. Such actions are the natural expression by any
spirited force of its sense of initiative. Unless you sometimes take
some of the enemy's trenches, he will be taking yours. By striking him
in one section you may prevent him from striking you in another. Von
Moltke and the other great German generals were only following in the
footsteps of Napoleon when they taught that the offensive should be the
first thought of every soldier.</p>

<p>The offensive naturally seeks to flank its adversary. Lieutenant General
Winfield Scott once stated that if two lines of men, without any
officers, were placed in a field, one line would inevitably try to get
around the end of the other. The immensity of the forces, the power and
precision of modern armies in defense has lengthened the battle fronts
from a mile or a mile and a half in Napoleon's time to hundreds of
miles.</p>

<p>It is an old rule, that you cannot break through a battle front, which
means that you are thrusting in a wedge which will draw fire on both
sides. Pickett tried to break a battle front at Gettysburg. A frontal
attack which was no less pitiful in its results was that of the Federals
at Fredericksburg. Grant's hammering tactics against Lee succeeded only
by the flanking operations of superior numbers.</p>

<p>Strategically, the situation of the Central Powers was extremely strong.
Aside from the fact that their preparedness in numbers of trained men,
in arms and material, is too well known for mention here, their
excellent network of railways <span class="pagenum"><a id="page033" name="page033"></a>(p. 033)</span> enabled them to make rapid
concentration. They had what is known as the interior line, which gave
Meade his advantage at Gettysburg. Whether the interior line is three
miles or a thousand miles long does not affect the principle involved.
Interior lines mean quick transportation of reserves from point to point
in concentration. It does not matter whether their numbers are hundreds
or hundreds of thousands; the advantage is intrinsically the same.
Joffre had probably fifteen hundred thousand on the interior line of the
Marne. Meade had seventy thousand at Gettysburg.</p>

<p>In keeping with all great plans that of the Central Powers was extremely
simple. Austria was to look after Russia. She could mobilize more
rapidly than Russia, and her army was counted upon to take the offensive
into Russia and deliver a hard blow before the Russian was ready to
receive her. Indeed, the Austrian was to attempt in the east what the
German attempted in the west. The German army was confident that in any
event the slowness of Russian mobilization would give it time for its
daring venture in the west. As the French, too, had excellent railroad
systems, they also would mobilize rapidly. The full strength of the
German army, therefore, was thrown against the French and the little
Belgian army of eighty thousand ill trained and equipped men in the
first month of the war. By using their interior lines, striking first in
the west and then in the east, the Germans were warranted on paper in
counting on successes that might have ended the war within the first
four or five months.</p>

<p>The frontier of France from Switzerland to Luxemburg, when manned by the
large numbers of the French army, became a battle front. There was no
room for a flanking operation. German ambition for a decisive and prompt
victory over the French army must have room for a turning movement. The
Germans made the invasion of Belgium a military necessity for their
purpose, which was the destruction of the French army. They had built
the great 17-inch mortars for smashing the Belgian fortresses in order
to open the gate for the flood which was to sweep southward to Paris.
These guns were less practicable for <span class="pagenum"><a id="page034" name="page034"></a>(p. 034)</span> field work or even for
trench work, being best against cities and stationary guns in forts.</p>

<p>Thus the German plan of campaign was fully developed the second day of
the war. It was no longer a secret to the general public, let alone to
the French staff, which recognized that it had to deal with this effort
of the German wing to come through Belgium. A French movement into
Alsace failed. The public reason given for this was that it was a
political demonstration in raising the Tricolor over the "lost
provinces" dear to the heart of every Frenchman. Another&mdash;a military
reason&mdash;which would seem a more obvious one to the soldier, was a
counteroffensive to draw off the force of the German offensive at Liege
and Namur, hoping thus, at least, while Liege and Namur were holding the
German right in position, to force the German left to the bank of the
Rhine. If you will look at the map you will see that this strategy
becomes transparently intelligible.</p>

<p>Thus early in August the French were trying to turn the German left, and
the Germans were preparing to turn the French left. Had the Belgians had
anything like an adequate army, had it been skillfully handled; had the
fortress of Namur held ten days as many thought it would, the German
right might have been held long enough to prevent the Germans forcing a
battle on the Marne. By the third week of August, however, the Germans
had won their first point. They had broken through Namur, so incapably
defended. They had broken the French left, put the British to flight,
compelling the withdrawal of the French from German Lorraine, and now
the war in the west was being waged entirely on French soil.</p>

<p>Technically and strategically the French had been outdone by superior
numbers and the incapable defense of Namur, but no decisive battle had
been fought. Indeed in a maneuver for positions, the Germans had won.
The test was to come on the Marne. Had France been beaten there, she
would have been beaten for good. Her army would have been so badly
shattered that the Germans would then have been able to have thrown such
preponderance of force, in conjunction with the Austrians, against the
Russians that Warsaw (and perhaps Petrograd) must have fallen <span class="pagenum"><a id="page035" name="page035"></a>(p. 035)</span>
in the first year rather than in the second of the campaign. It would
not be going too far to call the Marne the greatest battle in all
history, both because of the numbers engaged and the result. Barring a
later successful German offensive it decided the fate of France and very
likely the fate of the war. All the trench fighting that followed, after
all, only nailed down as it were the results of the Marne.</p>

<p>The general public taking its news from the daily press, thinks of the
Marne as having been waged mostly in the neighborhood of Paris. It also
wonders why the Germans did not go into Paris when they were so near.
Any entrance into Paris was of secondary and of superficial
consideration. The object of an army is to beat an enemy's army. Had the
German army beaten the French on the Marne, then it had plenty of time
for its entry into Paris. If it lost the battle, it could not have held
Paris.</p>

<p>The fate of Paris was no less decided in eastern France than on the
banks of the Marne. Far and away from a spectacular point of view, the
most interesting portion of that decisive conflict was among the hills
and valleys and woods of Lorraine, where over a front of eighty miles
the Bavarians and the French swayed back and forth in fierce pitched
battle. For the Bavarians were striking at the French right flank toward
the gap of Miracourt and the German Crown Prince was striking in the
Argonne at the same time that Von Kluck was striking at the French left.
The Bavarians and the crown prince failed, while Von Kluck extended
himself too far and was nearly caught in the pincers by Manoury's new
army striking on his flank. But the vital, the human, the overwhelming
factor was that the French infantry after retreat, when they might have
been in confusion and poor heart, held with splendid stubbornness and
organization under the protection of the accurate fire from their field
batteries of 75's.</p>

<p>It is estimated that the Germans had actually on the front, or within
ready reach of the front in the battle of the Marne, 2,500,000 men,
while the French had 1,500,000. As the population of France is
approximately forty-five million and that of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page036" name="page036"></a>(p. 036)</span> Germany seventy
million, the ratio in armed men to population was substantially the same
for either combatant. For any decisive offensive the Germans needed that
percentage of superior numbers. The fact that they failed carried its
own significance.</p>

<p>Though they withdrew they were by no means decisively beaten. It might
be said&mdash;to give them the fullest benefit of the doubt&mdash;that they
undertook to buy something and the price was too high. To insist,
however, that they did not make their best effort is to imply that the
Germans were unwilling to pay the price for that decisive victory which
would win the war. They could not take the risk of going too far or
pressing too long and too hard; for that might have meant, with the
rapid mobilization of French reserves, a defeat that would have thrown
them clear out of France and lost the war for them.</p>

<p>The Germans had profited by all the lessons of the Russo-Japanese War,
which taught the importance of trenches to modern armies, and also the
value of high-explosive shells, but their own expenditure of shells had
been far beyond their anticipation, and so far as we can learn, at the
Marne they faced a shortage. They lacked the munitions to carry on the
battle to a conclusion, even if they possessed the men and the will.</p>

<p>Accepting the principle of the increased power of the defensive of
modern armies, they fell back to the defensive line of the Aisne, and
now the initiative must be with the French. There followed a movement of
precisely the kind characterizing many battles over a smaller front and
that was the extension of the line as reserves were brought up by either
side.</p>

<p>The French tried to flank the German left but the Germans extended as
rapidly as they, until the month of October found both armies resting
one flank on the sea and the other on Switzerland. Still another reason
for the German withdrawals from the Marne was the loss of the battle of
Lublin by the Austrians, due not to the inferiority of the Austrian
troops so much as to bad generalship.</p>

<p>The German staff was warranted by the defeat at Lublin in thinking that
they might have overestimated the Austrian <span class="pagenum"><a id="page037" name="page037"></a>(p. 037)</span> army and
underestimated the Russian. In this case they might face the danger of
an invasion of Germany itself from Russia. Owing to the heterogeneous
character of the Austrian army with its many races and the many
pessimistic prophesies that have been made about the loyalty of the Slav
portions of Austria, which were fulfilled it is said by the mutiny of
some Slav regiments, it looked as if such apprehensions had been well
grounded.</p>

<p>In winning Lublin the Russians had done a distinct service to the French
in relieving pressure at the Marne and by their invasion of East Prussia
they undertook a service of a similar kind. The advance of the Russian
"steam roller" into Prussia so much heralded at the time amounted to
little more than an immense raid, as numbers go in the greatest struggle
of all history.</p>

<p>It won laurels for Von Hindenburg, a retired general, who became the
hero of the war in Germany, again illustrating that in this, as in other
wars, the fortune of circumstances and the character of your enemy have
much to do with the creation of martial glory. For it is an open
question if as a military feat Von Kluck's skillful extrication of his
army from the position beyond Paris is not as worthy of praise as Von
Hindenburg's clever victory of Tannenberg.</p>

<p>Though the German armies had not been able to gain a decisive victory
over the French, they had established themselves on French soil. All the
destructive effects of war must be borne by their adversary while they
could make use of the regions occupied to supply and feed their troops.
They had put the burden of direct economic waste on the French and
deprived them of economic supplies, while the psychologic value of
driving home to the enemy population the ravages of war is considered
important by military leaders.</p>

<p>Nor could the economic advantage be adequately measured by extent of
area occupied; for the one-twenty-sixth of the territory of France which
was held by the Germans represented far more than one-twenty-sixth of
French producing power for war purposes. A nation's true material wealth
in peace may be in <span class="pagenum"><a id="page038" name="page038"></a>(p. 038)</span> its farms and vineyards, but in war it is
in the coal and steel and machine shops. The "Black Country" of northern
France of no interest to the tourist, plays the same part to industrial
France that the Pittsburgh region plays to industrial America. Besides,
with Lille in German hands, France had lost the income from her export
trade in textiles.</p>

<p>As the Russians for lack of transport were not able to follow up their
success at Lublin, the succeeding weeks showed it to be far from a
decisive victory. The Austrian army soon recovered itself. In comparison
with Russia, both Austria and Germany were highly organized industrial
nations. They had not only been able to put larger forces into the field
at the outset than their adversaries, but they had the resources in guns
and rifles, and in the factories for the manufacture of munitions, which
enabled them to increase their actual fighting forces faster than their
adversaries, and to supply them with larger quantities of munitions.</p>

<p>The German army was established in well-chosen positions in France,
which might be impregnable against even forces as superior as three to
one; the Austrian army was safely established in front of the Russians.
Both the French and the Russians were short of munitions, and
particularly of guns of heavier caliber, and of high-explosive shells,
which had become most essential in trench warfare. Relatively, the
Germans were depending upon their guns to hold the Aisne line, while the
Allies were depending upon the flesh and blood of infantry. Germany was
rushing every trained man she had to the front and training a million
volunteers. Now she could spare troops moved by her efficient railroad
system, taking advantage of the interior line for Von Hindenburg to make
a drive toward Warsaw, where he repeated the same maneuver, in keeping
with German practice of the advance to the Marne. After his drive, he
fell back from Warsaw, and intrenched for the winter.</p>

<p>An unskilled garrison of Belgians held Antwerp, which was on the flank
of the German forces in Belgium. The fall of this fortress meant the
release of a considerable force of Germans, and allowed their heavier
concentration toward northwestern <span class="pagenum"><a id="page039" name="page039"></a>(p. 039)</span> France. Having failed to
defeat the French at the Marne, which would have dropped not only the
ports of Dunkirk, Calais, and Boulogne, but also Havre, like ripe plums
into their basket, the Germans next sought to take Calais, which is
twenty-two miles from the coast of England. With Calais went the
possession of all Belgium, a strip of northern France, and a foothold on
the coast within twenty-two miles of England, and with the free sweep of
the Atlantic past the narrow English Channel in front. Von Moltke, the
chief of the German staff, who was retired about this time, was said to
have still favored the greater conception of a decisive victory over the
French army by an attack on Verdun instead of on the Channel ports; and
the kaiser's own idea was said to have prevailed against his.</p>

<p>Now the allied armies in the west were to face a test second only to
that of the Marne. The British army, which had been in the neighborhood
of Soissons, had moved down to the left flank, hoping to assist in a
successful turning movement. Their little force was being increased by
every reserve that they could muster and arm. From India they brought
their native troops, long-service men trained by British officers.
These, at a time when every man of any kind was needed, were thrown into
the crucible of the coming conflict, which reached its climax during the
last days of October in the chill rains and mists of Flanders, with rich
fields of a flat country turned into a glutinous mud.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in a futile attempt, the British rushed small forces of
marines to the assistance of the Antwerp garrison. With Antwerp theirs,
the Germans were free to concentrate against the Channel ports. Once
more the offensive was entirely with them in the west. They even brought
into action some of the regiments of volunteers who had been enlisted in
August; and following the German system of expending a fresh regiment in
a single charge, these new levies were sent in masses to the attack. The
Belgians, including those who escaped from Antwerp and from being driven
into Holland, rested their left on the sea. Some sixty thousand were all
they could muster out of a population of seven millions for the defense
of the sliver of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page040" name="page040"></a>(p. 040)</span> country that still remained under their flag.
A type of man-of-war which was supposed to be antedated, the monitor,
with its low draft and powerful guns was brought into action by the
British in protecting the Belgians, who finally saved themselves by
flooding their front.</p>

<p>Next to the Belgians was a French army, and next to them the British
army, which shared with the French the brunt of the attack in that
sector around the old town of Ypres, which was to give its name to the
Ypres salient, the bloodiest region of this war, and of any war in the
history of Europe.</p>

<p>So far as one can learn, the losses of the British and the French here
were about 150,000, and of the Germans, about 250,000. Within the
succeeding year, probably another 200,000 men of both sides were killed
and wounded in the same locality. At the lowest estimate, 100,000 men
have been killed outright in the Ypres salient, without either side
gaining any appreciable advantage. British regiments held in the first
battle of Ypres in some cases when they had a loss of 80 per cent.</p>

<p>Both Germans and Allies fought in icy water up to their hips. Many who
survived succumbed to the cold. Lacking proper artillery support, the
British used to cheer when the Germans charged, as that meant the end of
shell fire, and they could come to close quarters with the bayonet.
Little by little, but grudgingly, they had to yield against that
persistent foe. The German staff was at its best in its organized
offensive, and the British at their best "sticking," as they call
it&mdash;and the prize was an arm of salt water, to be all Ally or part
German. When the Germans gave up the struggle, they had the advantage of
ground and the British stayed where they were. Whether or not the Allies
should have evacuated Ypres and the deadly Ypres salient and withdrawn
to better strategic positions will ever be a subject of discussion; but
the loss of the city at the time would have had a moral effect on the
situation of the Allies, and the political consideration may have
outweighed the military.</p>

<p>Thus the campaign of the first summer and fall came to an end. The
Allies had failed in their hope of keeping the German within his
borders; and the German had failed to win any decisive <span class="pagenum"><a id="page041" name="page041"></a>(p. 041)</span> victory
which could enforce peace on all or any one of the Allies.</p>

<p>The casualties, on account of the vast numbers engaged, had been
staggering. Germany held a small strip of Poland, and about the same
amount of territory in France that she was to hold a year later, while
Russia held a large section of Galicia. Where the armies had operated,
lay broad belts of ruins, destroyed at enormous cost by shell fire. The
moralist might well ask if the nations would have entered the war if
they could have foreseen the result of their first four months'
struggle.</p>


<h4>SEA POWER</h4>

<p>For any adequate understanding of the strategy of the war as a whole,
the trench line from Switzerland to Flanders must be extended to the
east of England across the North Sea to Iceland. This war has again
demonstrated the enormous value of sea power.</p>

<p>Glance at a map of the globe and you will see how small a portion of it
is occupied by the great nations of Europe, which for 2,000 years have
been the most vital and influential political, commercial, and
intellectual force in the world. The present nations are for the most
part only the modern expression of the vigorous races which Cæsar found
and conquered. They have been in continual competition and in frequent
wars.</p>

<p>The Russians have had only a little hold on the sea&mdash;in the Black Sea
and in the Baltic; the Germanic peoples have had the Baltic and the
North Sea; France faces the Mediterranean and the Atlantic; and only
twenty-two miles from France is the island of Britain and Ireland, and
other little islands, or what are known as the British Isles, whose
superficial area is less than that of France or Germany.</p>

<p>Look again at the map, at the location of the British Isles and Germany.
Mark them in black, if you will, and those two little points represent
the two great antagonists in the war. Then turn the globe around slowly,
and you come to Canada, stretching from the frontier of the United
States to the Arctic, and across <span class="pagenum"><a id="page042" name="page042"></a>(p. 042)</span> the Pacific to Australia and
Hongkong, the Straits Settlements and Ceylon, India, and then in Africa,
the most valuable of all its area&mdash;and you have the dominions and the
colonies of the British Empire!</p>

<p>Between Germany and the rest of the world is the British navy. Every
German ship which sails the trade routes of the earth must go past the
British threshold. Germany, with a rapidly increasing population, with
an imperial patriotism which discouraged emigration to foreign
countries, wished to extend her domain; she wanted room in which German
national ambition could expand.</p>

<p>Through all her history, Britain has had one eye on the continent and
one on the seas. Continental affairs concerned her only so far as they
meant the rise of any power which might threaten her dominion of the
seas. The silver-pewter streak of channel kept her safe from invasion by
any continental power, yet she could land troops across the Channel and
throw the weight of her forces in the balance when her dominion was
threatened. It is her boast that she has always won the "last battle,"
which is sufficient. She had only 30,000 troops in the allied army under
Wellington, which delivered the finishing blow to Napoleon.</p>

<p>Twenty years ago, when the German navy was in its infancy, her policy
was one of splendid isolation. France then was the second naval power,
and Russia the third. The British naval program was superior to any two
continental powers. The increase in German population and in trade and
wealth brought with it an increase in the German navy, until Germany,
with her ally, Austria, became the threatening continental factor to
British security.</p>

<p>Now Britain formed a combination for defense with Russia and France. Her
military part was to send 120,000 troops across the Channel to cooperate
with the French army against the Germans. She was the only one of the
great nations, except the United States, that depended upon a regular
army, which was occupied mostly in policing her empire. Aside from her
regulars, her only military organization were her Territorials, which
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page043" name="page043"></a>(p. 043)</span> were something on the same order as the American National
Guard.</p>

<p>The number of men which she could throw across the Channel was therefore
insignificant, compared to the great hordes of the European armies. Her
real part was command of the sea. She was either to destroy the German
navy or make it helpless in interfering with allied trade on the seas.
Her Government was Liberal, her people as a whole skeptical of the
possibility of a European war. For centuries they had been bred to
believe that her security was in her fleet. She had long enjoyed her
empire, she possessed immense capital, and her inclination was toward
complacency, while Germany's was that of the eager newcomer to power.</p>

<p>The situation in Ireland on account of the passage of the Home Rule Bill
had become so strained that many people believed civil war to be
inevitable. The conviction of the German Ambassador in London, as well
as most German observers, was that Britain would not actually enter the
war, when the test came. Upon her decision, it is now evident, depended
the fate of Europe. With England out, the French army could not have
saved France. For then, Germany could have had the freedom of the seas.
Her navy would have sent the French into harbor, closing not only every
French, but every Russian port to the entrance of supplies and
munitions, which would have meant food scarcity in France, and utter
scarcity of munitions in Russia.</p>

<p>German troops could have landed in France to the rear of the French
army. The whole complexion of the war would have been changed. So well
laid were their plans, so sure were they of their numbers of men and
guns, which they could promptly concentrate, that there seems little
question of the ability of the Central Powers to have crushed France in
the first three months of the war, and then to have won a decisive
victory over Russia, bringing home from either country great
indemnities, and, with Germany, if she choose, annexing northern France
and Belgium.</p>

<p>Thus the Central Powers would have established themselves so strongly as
the dominant nations of Europe, that Germany with <span class="pagenum"><a id="page044" name="page044"></a>(p. 044)</span> her seventy
millions of people could have directed her energy as the next step in
her career against the Mistress of the Seas.</p>

<p>Had Belgium not been invaded, it is questionable if the British public
would have favored joining in the war. But this aroused public
indignation to the breaking point in support of the war members of the
cabinet. Sir Edward Grey, the British Minister of Foreign Affairs, had
his way.</p>

<p>The British navy was as thoroughly prepared for an emergency as the
German army. It had no illusions as to the nature of its task or of its
responsibility to the nation. Britain had superior resources in
shipbuilding to Germany. She had a fleet superior in every class of
ship, and she had led the world in naval progress&mdash;both her dreadnoughts
and her battle cruisers being of a later type than her rival's. Her
desire, inevitably, was that the German fleet should come out at once
and give battle. Confident of the outcome, she contemplated the removal
of her rival from the seas at a single blow.</p>

<p>German naval policy was as careful to avoid this test as British was to
invite it. The German navy was kept safely at anchor in Kiel, protected
by immense fortress guns, by elaborate mine fields, scores of submarines
and destroyers, and by numerous nets against the approach of any British
submarine. There was no way for any enemy to reach it except by the air.
The Germans would have located any British attempt to attack their navy,
as it might have meant the loss of important British fighting units
which would have given the Germans more nearly equal chances of victory
if they chose to precipitate an engagement. Sir John Jellicoe, in
command of the fleet, however, refused to take any risks of losing his
units. He kept his fleet in harbor, ready at any moment to steam out
into the North Sea for action. Throughout the war to this writing, not
one of his great first-class battleships has fired a shot, with the
exception of the <i>Queen Elizabeth</i>, which took part in the bombardment
of the Dardanelles forts.</p>

<p>Superiority of gun power has been sufficient to keep England safe from
invasion, German merchant ships from sailing the seas, protect the sea
passage of millions of troops, and insure the occupation of the German
colonies by British expeditionary <span class="pagenum"><a id="page045" name="page045"></a>(p. 045)</span> forces. Except as it was
raised over a submarine or commerce raider, the German flag was swept
from the sea within the first six months of the war.</p>

<p>There has been no naval battle at all commensurate with the strength of
the two fleets. Each time that a British and German ship have met in
action, the overwhelming importance of speed and of gun range have been
demonstrated. Speed and range enabled Von Spee to destroy Cradock's
squadron at Coronel off Chile, with almost no loss to himself. Later at
the Falkland Islands he suffered the same fate at the hands of Sturdee,
who, with his second-class battle cruisers, had the speed and range of
the German third-class.</p>

<p>Again, in the battle off Dogger Bank, the <i>Blücher</i>, the second-class
battle cruiser which had only 26 knots, was left behind by her sisters,
the German first-class battle cruisers, while she was pounded into the
sea by the <i>Lion</i>, the <i>Tiger</i>, and the <i>Princess Mary</i>, which were
driving ahead at 30 knots. The honors of the war, so far as the
offensive goes, therefore, have been with the last battle cruiser.</p>

<p>German naval policy, no less wise for its own ends than for the British,
has depended upon the submarine, whose importance may be easily
exaggerated and easily underestimated. No submarine can approach the
major fighting ships of a great fleet when that fleet is properly
protected by torpedo-defense guns and fast destroyers and light
cruisers. The deciding test of a submarine's power in this respect was
the fruitless attempts of the best German submarines to reach the <i>Lion</i>
with a deathblow, when crippled, after the battle off Dogger Bank, she
was being towed home at 5 knots an hour, under the protection of the
destroyers.</p>

<p>However, any isolated vessel, whether a merchantman or a man-of-war, is
at the mercy of a submarine, which hunts the seas for this kind of
target. It has only to lie in wait on the trade routes until its prey
appears, submerging in case of danger. Then a torpedo sent home and a
valuable piece of property goes to the bottom of the sea. What
resourceful brigandage is to traffic on the highways, the German
submarine became to British traffic on the seas. It is the sniper of
naval warfare, but cannot give <span class="pagenum"><a id="page046" name="page046"></a>(p. 046)</span> battle. It must find its
protection under the sea, while all freight and all passengers, all the
world's business is done on the surface of the sea; and the great guns
of the dreadnoughts command the surface.</p>

<a id="img004" name="img004"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img004.jpg" width="400" height="635" alt="" title="">
<p>George V, King of Great Britain and Emperor of India.</p></div>

<p>When brigandage becomes highly organized, it means enormous expense in
increased police work, particularly if you cannot trail the brigands to
their hiding places and force them to capitulate. In this case the
brigands' hiding places are under the protection of powerful fortress
guns and mine fields in secure harbors.</p>

<p>The British navy, with over three thousand ships, including mine
sweepers and auxiliaries of all sorts under Sir John Jellicoe's command,
was forced to go to immense expense and pains in combating the submarine
campaign. Many submarines were taken; but the Germans kept on building
them. It was a war against an unseen and cunning foe, which required
ceaseless vigilance and painstaking effort. The amount of material, as
well as the amount of ships required in order to combat the submarines
and also to keep the patrol intact from the British channel to Iceland,
could it be enumerated, would stagger the imagination. Meanwhile,
England had to go on building new dreadnoughts and cruisers and
destroyers at top speed, with a view to increasing her rate of naval
superiority over the Germans. Once the German fleet had come out and
been beaten, then the British would be secure in victory, and they could
spare many guns for the army and devote all their energy to the land
campaign.</p>

<p>While the Germans had a "fleet in being," they had an important counter
for peace negotiations. They were as rightly advised in sticking to
their harbor, as the British in holding their command of the sea without
risking their units by trying to force an entrance into harbors equipped
with every known defense of modern warfare.</p>

<p>In all instances the British army must wait for material if navy demands
were unsatisfied. With the tide of fortune going against the Russians
and French on the Continent, the original agreement for only 120,000 men
became entirely perfunctory, in view of the tragic necessity of more
troops to be thrown against the Central <span class="pagenum"><a id="page047" name="page047"></a>(p. 047)</span> Powers on the
Continent. With a large proportion of her regular officers killed in the
first two months of the war, Britain had to undertake the preparation of
a vast army without adequate drill masters or leaders. She had to make
wholly untrained civilians into soldiers while the war was being waged.
This took time, but less time than for the manufacture of rifles and
guns. She had everything necessary for supplying her navy, but
ridiculously inadequate plants for supplying a force of soldiers so
immense. Thus England had scores of battalions of excellently drilled
soldiers prepared to go to France before there were any rifles for them
to fight with, or before they had the all-important artillery for their
support in battle.</p>

<p>In the early months of the war probably she was not awake to the
necessity of the situation. Besides, her manufacturers, still confident
of an early victory over Germany, were more interested in permanently
gaining markets which the Germans would lose than in making munitions.
The war was not brought home to the Englishman as it was to the German
and the Frenchman, by having bloody lines of trenches on his own soil.
Every British soldier was fighting across the seas in the defense of the
soil of another nation. Naturally, in many cases, he was slow to a
realization that this also was his own national defense. But by the
volunteer system alone, England enlisted over two million men before
conscription was threatened.</p>

<p>In order to centralize authority under a single man, Lord Kitchener was
intrusted with the stupendous task of organizing the new army and seeing
that it was properly equipped. He had foreseen at the start that the war
would be long and that it would be nearly two years before England could
throw anything like an armed force adequately representing her
population into the struggle on the Continent. He had to train his
officers at the same time that he trained his men and build guns and
make rifles.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the German army system was complete. Indeed, there was no
want of men with military experience in any one of the continental
countries to act as drill masters. England was attempting a feat equaled
only in our Civil War, where vast <span class="pagenum"><a id="page048" name="page048"></a>(p. 048)</span> armies of untrained men were
raised. But in this case, the enemy was not composed also of recruits,
but of men trained under universal service by a staff which had
traditions of preparedness as a basis for the preparation before the
war, while the British staff and the British army had been trained in
the handling of small, mobile forces in policing their empire. But as
the months wore on, it was evident that the military decision of the war
might rest with this new army when the other armies were exhausted, when
at last it reached the front in full force with adequate arms and
equipment in the hope of repeating history, thanks to the command of the
sea which gave Britain time to prepare&mdash;by winning the last battle.</p>

<p>Had Britain lost command of the sea early in the war, she would have
been utterly helpless. The Germans could readily have landed a force
that would have taken London in six weeks. Even this would have been an
unnecessary military action. For, with her food supply shut off by
German ships, Britain would have had to throw up her hands and ask for
terms.</p>

<p>The Dominion of Canada, Australasia and South Africa would have found
themselves in the position of isolated nations, dependent for the time
being upon their own resources for defense. Their loyalty to the British
Empire has not been the least wonderful of the many wonderful results of
this war. They have sent legions of volunteers across the seas to France
and Gallipoli to fight beside the British and the French. As for
Hongkong, the Straits Settlements, Ceylon, India, and all the colonies
of the empire, they would have been Germany's for the occupation. Such
is the meaning of sea power. But the British navy being superior to the
German, held Germany in siege.</p>


<h4>THE SECOND SUMMER'S CAMPAIGN</h4>

<p>Germany must make the best possible use of her comprehensive industrial
organization and of her preparedness for war and throw the greatest
possible number of men into the fighting line at the earliest possible
moment. She was practically in a race against time; and time was with
the Allies. While <span class="pagenum"><a id="page049" name="page049"></a>(p. 049)</span> they retained command of the sea the United
States and other neutral nations overseas, once their plants for
manufacture were completed, could pour out supplies of munitions.</p>

<p>Germany's foreign trade was practically at a standstill. From the port
of Hamburg her argosies of manufactures no longer went forth to the
world in return for raw material. Her many ships, from the enormous
passenger steamers to the small tramps which had brought her tribute
with their carrying trade, were idle. She could manufacture, then, only
for home consumption and all her plants that had been manufacturing for
export began producing for her armies. The energies of the one hundred
and twenty-five millions of people, men, women and children, in Germany
and Austria-Hungary were wholly occupied in making war. Their object
must be to push the walls back as far as they could, and so to punish
Russia or France that one or the other would yield a separate peace. The
aim of British statesmanship must be to hold the Allies together at any
expense and keep Germany from breaking the siege. If more nations could
be brought in against Germany, that would strengthen the siege lines and
lengthen the front the Central Powers were building.</p>

<p>Through the winter of 1914-15 the diplomats of the Allies and the
Central Powers in Rome fought for Italy's hand with all the skill and
resources of trained European diplomacy. Responding to the sentiment for
the recovery of Trentino and Trieste which she considered ethnologically
and geographically a part of her domain she was to throw in her fortunes
with the Allies against her old enemy, Austria.</p>

<p>Serbia had her troops still on the boundary of the Danube and the Save.
Rumania, facing Austria with Russia on her flank, also much courted, was
even more coy than Italy. Bulgaria, with her excellent army, was on the
flank of Serbia and blocked the road to Turkey. Little Greece was
another state watching the conflict with the selfish interest of a small
spectator, trying to judge which side would be the victor.</p>

<p>Russia of the steppes and the multitudes of men was short of munitions;
her plants were incapable of making sufficient <span class="pagenum"><a id="page050" name="page050"></a>(p. 050)</span> supplies. The
Baltic was closed to her by the German navy, Archangel was frozen in and
the closing of the passage of the Dardanelles shut her off from the
Mediterranean. She was in touch with the sea only in the Far East, with
the Pacific Ocean and the Rocky Mountains between her and the
manufacturing regions of the United States. Her crop of wheat, which she
exchanged for manufactured goods in time of peace was no less interned
than the manufactured products of Germany. If the Dardanelles were
opened she could empty her granaries and receive arms and munitions in
return. Therefore, the first winter of the war, while their main armies
were intrenched in colder climes, both sides turned their attention to
the southeast. In November the Turks had joined the Central Powers, thus
flying in the face of the historical Turkish policy, so cleverly applied
by Abdul Hamid, in playing one European power against another and
profiting by their international differences.</p>

<p>For many years German diplomacy, capital and enterprise had been busy
building up German influence in Asia Minor. Abdul Hamid had been
overthrown under the leadership of Enver Pasha and other officers who
had been trained in Germany according to German military methods and who
had absorbed the German ideas. Von der Goltz, a German general, had
reorganized the Turkish army. The access of Turkey to the Central Powers
formed the addition of another thirty million people, which gave them
one hundred and fifty million on their side.</p>

<p>Through the assistance of the Turks, the Germans never for a moment
deserting their idea of keeping the initiative and forcing their enemies
to follow it, threatened an offensive against the Suez Canal, which was
abortive, but served the purpose of requiring British preparation for
its defense. Germany saw more than mere military advantage in the
Turkish adventure. She was reaching out into the Mohammedan world which
stretches across Persia and Asia Minor, through little known and
romantic regions, to India where, as a part of her Indian Empire,
England rules more Mohammedans than the population of the German Empire.
The unrest which was reported to have been ripe in India for the last
decade might thus be brought to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page051" name="page051"></a>(p. 051)</span> a head in a rebellion against
British authority; as it might, too, in Egypt, the Sultan of Turkey
being the Padishah or head of the Mohammedan faith.</p>

<p>At least Britain would be forced to maintain larger garrisons than usual
both in Egypt and India against any threat of insurrection. Among all
who have had to deal with the Oriental peoples, and particularly those
who know them as intimately as the British rulers of India, the
importance of power&mdash;and publicly demonstrated power&mdash;is fully
understood. To the average British Indian or Egyptian subject, Britain
has been an unconquerable country, the mistress of the world.</p>

<p>Many reasons united in calling for some action on the part of the
British to offset that of the Germans. With Russia in retreat the Balkan
States, which had regarded her prowess as irresistible, were losing
their faith in the Allies. One successful blow would do more to dispel
their skepticism and to bring Italy in on the side of the Allies than
sheafs of diplomatic cablegrams and notes. During such a crisis every
message in the game of war diplomacy becomes only a polite calling card
that represents armed men.</p>

<p>The British decided to take the initiative though their new army had as
yet received hardly sufficient training to make them soldiers and their
supply of rifles, guns and munitions was insufficient. Indeed, England
was just beginning to awaken fully to the fact that the forces of France
and Russia alone were insufficient to cope on land with the Central
Powers, particularly now that the weight of Turkey was thrown in the
balance.</p>

<p>With her casualties three times the number of her original expeditionary
force, with more than the original number of her army engaged in
Flanders, she undertook an offensive against Constantinople itself.
Second-class men-of-war which were not required with the grand fleet and
a single first-class dreadnought of the latest type, the <i>Queen
Elizabeth</i>, in conjunction with a French squadron, bombarded and reduced
the ancient forts at the entrance to the Dardanelles and then attacked
those in the narrows. British bluejackets even smoked their pipes and
cracked jokes as they sat on the crest of Achi Baba, which became
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page052" name="page052"></a>(p. 052)</span> an impregnable Turkish position after the British
Mediterranean force was landed. Had the <i>Queen Elizabeth</i> been able to
fire an army corps ashore, the corps could have marched on into
Constantinople.</p>

<p>The success or failure of the Gallipoli expedition depended upon
surprise. Superficially it seems a colossal blunder. There are inside
facts about it which have never been disclosed. Greece, it is supposed,
agreed to send troops, but at the last moment changed her mind.
Undoubtedly the expedition was an important influence in bringing Italy
in. There was a fatal delay in its departure from Alexandria. Too much
time elapsed between the preparatory bombardment and the landing. The
Turks had been forewarned what to expect. They had leisure for
concentration and preparation. On a narrow front of difficult shore
where the landing was to be made, they had stretched their barbed-wire
entanglements into the sea itself, while along the beach were carefully
concealed machine guns and back of them ample forces of men and
artillery.</p>

<p>No effort in history was ever more gallant than that of the British
force, including the Australians, which threw itself ashore in the face
of simply insurmountable obstacles and fire, under the cover of the guns
of the men-of-war. As a surprise, the affair was a complete failure. Its
only chance of success being as a surprise, most competent military
leaders and experts agree that this was sufficient reason, in a military
sense, for an immediate withdrawal; yet British stubbornness would not
yield.</p>

<p>Indeed, the Gallipoli expedition was a political move, a violation of
the true military principle&mdash;that you should always go against the main
body of your enemy, which was at this time on the frontiers of Russia
and France. Of course the effort was not entirely without its
compensations; no expedition is, which holds any part of the enemy's
troops in place in front of your own. The pressure was withdrawn from
the Russians in the Caucasus and also further adventures from the
outskirts of Asia Minor toward India in stirring up the Mohammedan
population were for the time abated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page053" name="page053"></a>(p. 053)</span> The attempt to reach the heart of Turkish power, the sultan's
capital itself, by opening these famous straits and sending British
ships to lay Constantinople under their guns, was a splendid conception
worthy the military imagination of the daring ages when the British
Empire was built and the days of the Spanish Main, but the only
criterion in the ghastly business of war remains success.</p>

<p>Yet the spring of 1915 opened with no rebellion in India except sporadic
outbreaks of the frontier tribes which are always recurring, while Egypt
itself remained peaceful. The Germans inaugurated their second year's
campaign by closing the Belgo-Dutch frontier and by the administrative
use of every possible means for safeguarding their movements on the
western front, which would indicate that they were to undertake another
effort for the Channel ports. This was an obvious feint to conceal an
effort elsewhere. Instead of using troops to make it, they tried out for
the first time a form of warfare which was not new in the consideration
of any army, though it had not been used because it was considered
inhuman.</p>

<p>With the wind blowing in the right direction, the Germans released an
immense cloud of chlorine gas. Its gravity held it close to the ground
as it swept down upon the British and French in the famous Ypres
salient. The effort was successful beyond their expectation, more
successful than they realized and had they had sufficient reserves to
press on, they might have broken the allied line at this point.</p>

<p>The effect of the gas was that of a horrible form of asphyxiation; the
soldiers who did not succumb retreated in face of a weapon which could
not be countered by any in their possession. The casualties were heavy,
the sufferings of the wounded indescribable in their torment. From the
military point of view, which holds that war is killing and that any
method whatsoever is warrantable, the attack was a success as it gained
ground, and for the time being confused the enemy. But it was a form of
attack which could succeed only once. After the soldiers were provided
with proper respirators containing a chemical antidote, they were in no
danger of being "gassed." Among those in the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page054" name="page054"></a>(p. 054)</span> thick of the gas
attack were the first Canadian contingent, who bore themselves with
unflinching fortitude, not only that, but after the first surprise of
the attack was over, the survivors charged with rare heroism.</p>

<p>Strategy which formerly meant the swift movement of a few thousand
troops to one flank or another overnight, or in a two or three-hour
march, now means the concentration of hundreds of thousands by railway
trains upon a particular point and of many thousands of guns and
enormous quantities of material of every kind from shells to that for
building railroads to keep up with your advance.</p>

<p>But the general of to-day no less than the general of yesterday, would
always know where his enemy is most vulnerable, and strike him at that
point. In the spring of 1915, the line of least resistance for the
German army was obviously to the east where the loose organization of
the Russian army, lacking munitions, was stretched over a front of over
a thousand miles.</p>

<p>The French were better off in munitions, and their army and the British
had a front of four hundred and fifty miles of intact trench line. It is
estimated that in order to hold a battle front with modern troops, about
three thousand men to the mile are required. This does not mean that
there are three thousand actually on every mile; but counting the thin
line in the trenches, the thicker line in the reserve trenches and the
soldiers who are out of the trenches resting and the battalions in
reserve and the reserve supplies of men in the depots who can promptly
be brought into action.</p>

<p>For example, to hold a mile of the famous Ypres salient might require
double the number of men necessary to hold a mile where the lay of the
ground was in the favor of your troops. Owing to the use of motor trucks
and to railway trains, whenever there is an attack, concentration of men
at any point is very rapid. Holding to this rule, the Germans maintained
all through the summer of 1915, 1,500,000 men on their western front,
and they had that number at least to spare for their eastern front.
Field Marshal von Hindenburg said that by hammering he would <span class="pagenum"><a id="page055" name="page055"></a>(p. 055)</span>
get Warsaw, and he was to keep his word with stolid German persistence.
Napoleon, who had depended upon the number of his guns, would have fully
appreciated the Austro-German plan of action against Russia.</p>

<p>The Russian army has been compared to cotton wool. The farther you went
into Russia, the more cotton wool there was. The Russian army would
yield, but there never seemed any end of it. Gaining a passive victory
over the Russian army has also been compared to brushing the snow off
the front doorstep. The more you brushed, the more snow banked up.
Russia could afford to lose territory equivalent to the area of all
France without having received a vital blow. Russia has plenty of room
in which to retreat, as Napoleon learned. She is confident in the safety
of her distances. When the enemy falls back she follows on his heels.</p>

<p>At the end of the winter, 1914-15, she was still in the possession of a
large portion of Galicia. But the Germans were preparing a battering ram
which their generals thought irresistible. Their plan now was to deliver
so hard a blow at the Russian that he would be forced to yield a
separate peace. Von Mackensen formed his unprecedented phalanx of
soldiery and of artillery in Galicia and destroying all the
fortifications and covering the trenches with torrents of shell fire he
skillfully worked his legions forward, first breaking the Przemysl line,
which compelled a general retreat, and then breaking the Lemberg line.
Thus, having beaten back the Russian left wing, the Austro-Germans
turned their attention to the Warsaw front and there repeated the same
organized machine method of warfare. There were no brilliant strokes of
genius, but merely the use of superior systems of railroads in making
the concentration; of trained engineers and workmen in advancing the
railroad lines; of systematic overwhelming attacks at critical points,
directed by the unsurpassed German staff organization.</p>

<p>With the fall of Warsaw the Russian army was inevitably badly broken.
They had lost multitudes of prisoners, and staggering quantities of
material. But still it remained an intact army. It was not decisively
beaten. The prisoners were taken <span class="pagenum"><a id="page056" name="page056"></a>(p. 056)</span> by brigades, regiments, and
divisions&mdash;thousands of them in reserve, without a rifle in their hands,
as they waited their turn to pick up the rifle of a dead man. For six
months, March to August, the greatest of all campaigns in numbers of
troops and length of line continued in the east, Von Mackensen and the
Austrians striking in the south and Von Hindenburg in the north. Its
details will be read in the history which follows. Characteristic of
either adversary was his method. The German with concentration of
population, resources, artillery, soldiery, and organization, and the
Russian part, glamorous, slow, yielding to the terrific blows, flowing
back like an ebb tide, and taking his time, never risking a decision,
his army never surrounded or cut in two.</p>

<p>While Von Hindenburg's guns were hammering the Russians in front, German
political influence was occupied in Petrograd in the rear, where certain
official circles were under German influence in the hope of getting
Russia to capitulate. The situation was the most critical for the Allies
since the Battle of the Marne. A most influential court party was
undoubtedly in favor of capitulation. Russia was bleeding cruelly. She
was suffering the psychological as well as the material effects of
defeat. In Paris and London the possibility of having to go on with the
war without the Russian's assistance had become a serious consideration.
In short, the fate of Europe was then in the hands of diplomatic and
court intrigue.</p>

<p>According to the accounts it was the mass of the Russian people whose
pressure undoubtedly defeated the aims of German diplomacy. Uninformed
of the real situation, conscious only of the enormous cost of the war in
blood and treasure, their spirit of race patriotism was undaunted. They
realized if Russians in high places did not, that surrender by Russia
then meant a defeat, which would set the Russian power back for another
fifty years. England could make peace and be in possession of more
territory than she had at the beginning of the war. France could be
certain of retaining what she had before the war. But Russia had not
only lost Poland, but the Slav had bowed the knee to the Teuton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page057" name="page057"></a>(p. 057)</span> At the same time there was widespread unrest among the Russian
people. They felt that they had deserved victory, but had been denied
it. It was not a question of the grand duke's skill in conducting the
retreat from Warsaw, or his indomitable will and sturdy patriotism, but
of satisfying popular sentiment. The announcement that the czar himself
was to take command unified and heartened the Russian people, who felt
that "The Little Father" was the natural God-given head of the army.</p>

<p>There was discontent in Russia too, with the situation on the western
front. All the news that Russia had from France was of an occasional
hundred or five-hundred-yard trench won or lost, while the Russian army
had been swept from Galicia and been swept back again and had gone
through the fearful ordeal of the retreat of July and August. Why
shouldn't France and Britain do something to release the pressure on the
Russians? For not the least of the advantages the Central Powers had had
was single-headed direction. They represented one united force, working
out a consistent and simple plan of campaign. But Russia, England, and
France had to cooperate in council.</p>

<p>With Russia so hard pressed and with the danger of her yielding to the
Germans so deeply impressed on London and Paris there was nothing for
the French staff to do but to respond by some sort of action in loyalty
to her allies as a matter of military necessity if not of military
wisdom. The attacks in Artois had fully demonstrated the arduousness and
cost of any such undertaking, particularly until there was an unlimited
supply of shells to draw on. A gain of two or three miles' depth on a
front meant no positive advance for either side, but rather a waste of
life. Indeed, any considerable attack on that western trench line which
did not actually break the line must be considered a failure. And
against their will, no doubt, the French and British undertook another
offensive on September 25, 1915.</p>

<p>On many sections of the western front the nature of the ground makes an
attack absolutely unfeasible. The place chosen by the French was the
Champagne region, in the neighborhood of the great army review ground of
Châlons. It is a rolling, sterile country, dotted with sparse roads.
There is a thin loam <span class="pagenum"><a id="page058" name="page058"></a>(p. 058)</span> over a subsoil of chalk&mdash;excellent for
the defensive, but also permitting the rapid movement of artillery
troops in dry weather.</p>

<p>So far as can be learned the Germans had already given up their
offensive in Russia before the French began theirs. At least they were
well advised that the French offensive was under way, and they needed to
know it only a week beforehand, in order to transfer reserves from their
eastern front, which they brought to the number of 300,000,
concentrating them mostly in the Champagne region, where they were to be
needed. Coincident with the Champagne attack, the British, who are for
command purposes a part of the French army, launched one in the region
of Loos.</p>

<p>In northern France the country was extremely difficult, and as unsuited
for offense as the rest of the ground occupied by the British. Aside
from their object in assisting the Russians, the French hoped to break
the line. In this they failed. Over a twelve-mile front they gained
depths varying from one-half to three miles; and altogether, with the
British, they took some 25,000 prisoners and 160 guns. Both the numbers
of prisoners and of guns were small compared with the "bags" on the
eastern front. But the character of the fighting, the heavy volume of
artillery fire and extraordinary coordination of the first-class
fighting units by the most skilled armies in history, make this action
memorable in military annals in the same way as the German attack on
Verdun in the following February. The ground lost in no wise endangered
the German tenancy of their line.</p>

<p>Along the Italian front the summer had developed something of the same
kind of stalemate that had existed in France. Fighting in the Alpine
country so favored the defense that the Austrians did not have more than
three or four hundred thousand troops engaged in holding the Italians in
position. Therefore it had been easy for anyone taking a superficial
view to exaggerate the military value of Italy's entry into the war. The
Austrian troops had fought with extreme tenacity, for naturally the
Austrian staff had sent against the Italians all those troops in Franz
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page059" name="page059"></a>(p. 059)</span> Josef's heterogeneous empire who had any racial antagonism
against the Italians, including those who had been lukewarm in fighting
against the Slav.</p>

<p>Unquestionably, honors at the end of the campaign in 1915 were with
Germany. She had held her line solidly in the west. She had stripped the
country of northern France and Belgium of all the machinery of its
factories which would be useful to her. She had been relieved of any
necessity of feeding the Belgian population, or of the menace that would
have come from the threat of a famine in either Belgium or northern
France by the American Food Commission which at first had received
supplies from America to carry on their work, and later had depended
almost altogether upon grants from the French and English Governments
and upon large voluntary contributions from England. In the east she had
gained territory almost equal in area to that of Prussia itself. All
Poland was hers. Her governor general ruled Warsaw. Her situation as to
food supplies was improved by the occupation of immense productive
areas. She had made war with all her energy, and in want of able-bodied
men to gather her own harvests, she had used the hosts of prisoners
which she had taken from Russia. But, despite her victories, bravely and
skillfully won, she was still a nation in siege, with no communication
with the outside world, except through neutral countries.</p>

<p>In the second winter with uninterrupted energy she again turned toward
the southeast for another military adventure. Rumania still held fast to
her neutrality. In Bulgaria the Central Powers were to succeed in
gaining a fourth ally, which in sheer military advantage was probably
worth more than the accession of Italy to her enemies. Though Russia had
won her freedom for Bulgaria in '76, no sentiment drew her to Russia's
assistance when Russia was losing. No statesmanship is more matter of
fact than that of the Balkans. Bulgaria had an old score to settle with
Serbia, which had joined Rumania and Greece against her in making the
Second Balkan War, after she had borne the brunt of the first against
Turkey. Then, besides, the military temptation offered the Bulgarian
staff was irresistible. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page060" name="page060"></a>(p. 060)</span> Serbia had been through two wars
before the heavy drain of this one. A country of swineherds and
miserable villages, dependent for munitions upon England and the
Allies&mdash;she was caught in a wedge, with Bulgaria on the one side and the
Austro-Hungarian advance on the other. At the most the Central Powers
had probably no more than 300,000 troops&mdash;about the same number that the
Bulgars had. Against such a combination, Serbia, caught between the
blades of a pair of scissors, could make no successful resistance unless
assistance came from England and France, which the British and French
public demanded should be sent. There was no hope of sufficient allied
forces reaching Serbia in time to rescue her, but the Allies,
particularly the British, could not afford to see Saloniki occupied by
the Austro-Germans or by their friends, the Bulgarians. Up to the Balkan
War Saloniki was Turkish; then it became Greek. This excellent port had
long been the goal of Austrian ambition, which sought an outlet to the
Mediterranean, no less than the traditional policy of Russia was aimed
at the occupation of Constantinople.</p>

<p>In the Crimean War France and England fought to thwart Russia's designs
on Turkey and now France and England were prepared to oppose Austria's
designs on Saloniki.</p>

<p>In order to defend Saloniki British and French troops must land on the
soil of Greece and march across the Greco-Serbian frontier, which was no
doubt one of the reasons that had kept the Allies from sending forces
before, in order to assist the Serbians on the Danube and Save in
closing "the ring of steel."</p>

<p>Venizelos, the Greek statesman, who had been the Greek Bismarck in the
extension of the Greek domain in the Balkan War, had taken sides with
the Allies; and he favored concessions by Greece as well as Serbia to
Bulgaria, in order to satisfy Bulgarian ambitions and keep her from
striking hands with the Central Powers, while the King of Greece, with
the Queen, a sister of the kaiser, had decidedly pro-German leanings.
The Greeks had a most difficult part, even for Levantine diplomacy, to
play. If they cast their fortunes with the Allies and the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page061" name="page061"></a>(p. 061)</span>
Teutons won, then they could count upon the Central Powers not only
taking Saloniki away from them, but bringing themselves practically
under Germanic domination. If they openly espoused the German side, then
as the country depended upon the sea, their ports would be blockaded, if
not bombarded by the allied fleets. In the event of an allied victory
over the Central Powers they were certain that Saloniki would not be
annexed by the Allies, bitter as they were against Greece because she
was supposed to have broken her pledged word to assist them in the
Gallipoli expedition. Following a policy of drift and protest, the
Greeks consented to the British and French landing troops at Saloniki
and to their making it a base of action.</p>

<p>Certain forces were sent into Serbia before the Serbian army had been
completely driven back, and whatever the public thought, certainly with
no expectation of gaining a victory over the Bulgarians. This obvious
movement was only for the purpose of gaining time for fortifying a line
around Saloniki and bringing sufficient men and guns to defend it.</p>

<p>German diplomacy and staff work had not in all of the war gained a more
important technical advantage for less cost in time, money, and troops,
than it had in the fall of 1915 in the Balkans when they made the
Bulgars to serve as they had the Turks, to secure their ends. At last
the British withdrew from Gallipoli with such small losses that the
evacuation of this position on an exposed coast is undoubtedly one of
the most brilliant pieces of military maneuvering of its kind in all
history. No credit is ever given for retreats. But this was a good deal
more than a retreat. It was withdrawing from a beach in face of a
well-armed enemy. The story of it&mdash;as yet unwritten&mdash;will some day bring
a tribute to British military skill from professional soldiers, if not
from the lay public.</p>

<p>The Bulgarians decided not to invade Greece; the Greeks made no attack.
Those who looked forward to the war being settled in the Balkans, and to
Saloniki becoming another Port Arthur, had missed their calculations.
But every gun and every man that the Allies had to maintain at Saloniki
might be a gun and a man kept idle, when they might be needed elsewhere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page062" name="page062"></a>(p. 062)</span> The Germans having disposed of Serbia, had at the same time
forced the further dissipation of English and French troops. That they
could once more turn to the main theatre of the war and try to push back
the siege wall in another direction. Meantime, Turkey had been doing
their bidding in another quarter. The natural response of the British to
any threat to their Indian Empire was to take the offensive, for this
was one certain way to impress the Oriental mind. Having annexed Egypt
and Cyprus and occupied the German colonies throughout the world,
Britain now proceeded to the extension of her Asiatic domain. The threat
of Mohammedan insurrection was met by an invasion of Mohammedan regions.</p>

<p>Her expedition toward Bagdad, had it not been in the midst of the
greatest war in all history, would perhaps have been the most
spectacular and interesting of all the small campaigns in remote regions
which have gradually extended British influence. It marched through
Mesopotamia and the Garden of Eden. The Turks under German direction
replied with an offensive which in turn put General Townshend's army in
siege, requiring that it should have relief.</p>

<p>The self-interest of each one of the parties to the war is evident, with
the exception of Turkey. Why she ever entered in on the side of Germany,
or on either side, is a puzzle. She was the one to lose in any event.
German success meant German domination. German failure must mean that
Russia would realize her ambition to take Constantinople, and the
British must further strengthen their empire at her expense.</p>

<p>For many decades the British and Russian empires have glowered at each
other across the dividing belts of Thibet, Afghanistan, and Persia. The
fear of a Russian invasion of India haunted British statesmen until the
German power became so threatening that England struck hands with France
and Russia. Now while the British were advancing northward, the Russians
made a southerly move to her assistance. The grand duke, who had been
sent to the Caucasus in February, 1916, took the offensive and captured
the fortress of Erzerum, an action which was bound to relieve pressure
on the British. Thus, the Turk who <span class="pagenum"><a id="page063" name="page063"></a>(p. 063)</span> had been led to believe
that he was to regain Egypt and recover some of his lost territory, was
simply losing more. Indeed, after Saloniki, despite the talk to that
effect, the far-seeing Germans neither carried out their threatened
attempt to invade Egypt, nor, as many expected, were they drawn from the
main theatre of war by dispatching troops by rail to Turkey. In
dissipating the allied troops by their threats, they had taken care not
to dissipate their own.</p>

<p>Thus Germany would supply Turkey with officers, and all her munitions,
but she would not risk an army on the other side of Bulgaria with a long
line of communications threatened by the Allies from Saloniki and
Dedeagatch.</p>

<p>The approach of the spring of 1916 found them facing much the same
problem as in the spring of 1915. Despite the territory they had gained,
to ask for peace was to imply that their economic situation was weaker
and their casualties heavier than they were willing to admit. Even if
their economic situation was strong and the reserves plentiful, any
suggestion that they were ready for negotiations must convince the
Allies that they were reaching the end of their resources. There could
be no doubt of Russia's immense reserves of men. It was only a question
with her as to whether or not she could make them into an efficient army
properly equipped and supplied, and whether or not she would be able to
maintain her organization and railway facilities and sufficient forces
at the actual fighting front to strike a successful blow against her
enemies.</p>

<p>On the western front there had been an enormous accession of munitions
during the winter, while the British new army with two million men yet
to go under fire was gradually getting its rifles and guns. Victory
comes in war either when you are exhausted or when you have taken from
the enemy his capital or something of such vital importance to him that
he must yield in order to recover it. Neither France nor Russia was by
any means in that pass. Belgium had merely become a dead land, a shop
within a garden, cut off from all trade, when it had been a nation of
manufacturers and traders.</p>

<p>Germany, unless she were exhausted in men and supplies, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page064" name="page064"></a>(p. 064)</span> could
not consider any peace which did not accord her the results of her
gains, while she was still in possession of much of the enemy's
territory, and she still maintained the power of the offensive. The
purpose of the Allies was to contain her, to strengthen "the ring of
steel." Her own purpose must be to strike some vital blow which would
win a separate peace either from Russia or France. The moment she gave
up her offensive and settled down to the defensive, which was naturally
against the policy of her staff and the vigorous nature of her people,
she was acknowledging that she had reached the limit of her prowess.
Then the Allies, with the sea at their command, would bid her await
their pleasure&mdash;unless she had so far exhausted them that they
considered a decided victory over her hopeless, and they made a
compromise.</p>

<p>Saloniki now being an incident of her military past, the next plan of
her staff was an effort on Verdun, the great fortress which occupied a
salient in the French siege line. Here, as elsewhere when she attacked,
she concentrated both her own and the Austrian heavy artillery, and
following the system of intense artillery preparation, threw in her
waves of infantry. This blow was struck at the most inclement season of
the year, in February snow and slush and rain, as if to anticipate the
allied attack which was generally thought bound to come later in the
spring when sufficient munitions had been accumulated on the western
front and the weather was favorable.</p>

<p>By this time experts who had thought the war would be decided in the
Balkans had again realized that it never pays to desert the simple
military principle that the decision comes between the main bodies of
armies and not in remote regions from any clash of subsidiary forces.</p>

<p>Paris or Petrograd in the hands of the Germans might mean such a
decision. Certainly, should the western front be broken by either side,
it would be the most telling blow of the war in both the moral and the
military sense. But after all, was the line of least resistance for
Germany the line of the western front? Would she really strike her great
blow of 1916&mdash;if she still had the power to strike one&mdash;against the
western rather <span class="pagenum"><a id="page065" name="page065"></a>(p. 065)</span> than the eastern front? Hitherto, attacks had
succeeded against Russia.</p>

<p>It was in Russia that she had had her success. German officers had
always stated their confidence that with their superior gun fire and
tactics they could always force the Russians back. Could they press back
the French and the British?</p>

<p>When would the war end? seemed as unanswerable to the lay observer in
the spring of 1916 as in the spring of 1915. How long was the fearful
attrition to go on? Could either side ever strike a decisive blow, or
would the eventual result be a bloody stalemate, with England still in
command of the sea?</p>

<p>The significant generic lesson of the war is not in the power of
artillery, but the power of all material organization, when nations set
out to gain their ends by force: its military lesson was that both sides
had pretty well followed sound policy considering the situation, despite
armchair critics who knew nothing of inside facts.</p>

<p>Europe was spending $100,000,000 or more a day in the business of
destruction&mdash;of life and of property. A broad belt of ruins spread
across France and Belgium for 450 miles; a broader one of 1,000 miles
across Galicia and Russia. No nation engaged could be said to be
victorious except the Japanese. Japan had gained Kiao-chau; strengthened
her influence in China enormously, and was making immense profits by
working her arsenals and every plant at full speed making munitions for
Russia.</p>

<p>The United States at peace, preparing to make munitions as fast as she
could, and able to produce only 3,000 rifles a week for the Allies on
the 1st of December, 1915, and 5,000 a week March 1, 1916, was enjoying
an era of "boom" prosperity, thanks to the eager market of nations whose
own production was arrested while their workers were at war. From the
gloom of London and Paris, where men and women had given up all
luxuries, the transatlantic voyage brought you to New York, which was
the only gay capital in the world, enjoying all the privileges of
extravagance when money is plentiful.</p>


<h4><span class="pagenum"><a id="page066" name="page066"></a>(p. 066)</span> WAR BY MACHINERY</h4>

<p>This has been a war of machinery; but the old rule has been true that
development in any weapon of offense has been countered by further
development of means of defense. Nor is the theoretical power of weapons
ever equaled by their actual power when the test of war comes. With
self-preservation remaining the first law of nature, man is in nothing
so skillful as in avoiding the enemy's blows.</p>

<p>When one watches a 15-inch gun fired and hears its 2,000-pound shell go
screaming through the air, his concept of its destructive action is
exaggerated by imagination, and further confirmed if he sees that shell
burst inside a house, reducing its interior to wreckage. But the shell
may not hit the house; it may fall in an open field and merely make a
crater in the earth. Besides, someone must be in the house when it is
hit if there are to be any casualties; and it is quite possible that a
single person present might be dug out of the debris unharmed.
Vulnerable as man's flesh is, he remains a pretty small object on the
landscape. If he knows that his house is in danger of being struck he
then either goes into the cellar at the first alarm, after having
covered his floor with sandbags, or he may take to a dugout in his yard.</p>

<p>When one has seen ten 15-inch shells strike a town of 25,000 inhabitants
in a busy hour of the day and only half a dozen persons killed and
injured, he may learn a contempt for shell fire which, however, is
promptly turned into a tragic respect when one of the same sort of
shells strikes in a stone-paved courtyard where a hundred soldiers are
at their evening meal, and two-thirds of them are killed and wounded.</p>

<p>The bursting of a shrapnel shell and its spray of low-velocity bullets
is also theoretically most destructive, but a roof of 6-inch boards will
furnish perfect protection from the bullets. Mother Earth remains the
best protection there is from fire. No rifle bullet can penetrate
through a 3-foot thickness of sandbags. A 6 or 8-inch high-explosive
shell, which is the largest caliber <span class="pagenum"><a id="page067" name="page067"></a>(p. 067)</span> practicable for trench
warfare, may burst near a double layer of bags of stone rubble without
hurting anyone in a cellar 30 feet underneath. The rain of shrapnel
bullets which mows the barbed wire in front of a trench, as hail mows
ripening grain, will not reach a single man in the trench to the rear,
if he keeps his head down.</p>

<p>At first thought it seems utterly inconsistent when bullets carry
effectively a mile and a half, and guns carry twenty miles, that
infantry should be fighting so close that they can throw bombs at each
other from distances of 15 and 20 yards. The very destructiveness of
modern weapons has contributed toward this result.</p>

<p>There has never been anything like so many guns used in battle, and
never have they been capable of such rapid fire. The field gun can fire
consistently eight or ten shots a minute, thanks to its modern recoil
cylinder and to the steadiness of aim, and literally establish a
"curtain of fire" with its torrent of bullets shot down from the air and
the cataracts of earth shot up by the bursting of high-explosive shells
in the ground, which no infantry can pass.</p>

<p>A machine gun behind a shield firing 500 shots a minute is practically
safe from rifle fire, and soldiers intrenched on either side of it add
to its volume their own more accurate fire from their rifles. Infantry
in the open, though they were not subjected to the fearful concentration
of artillery fire, could not survive through a mile of machine-gun and
rifle-swept space. Successful advances against anything but very
inferior numbers badly armed become impossible in any frontal attack in
the open. Thus all modern infantry operations must have more or less a
siege character, as the only practicable means of approach is by digging
your way forward. The spade has become almost as important a weapon as
the rifle.</p>

<p>Impatience with digging, which was characteristic of the early days of
the American Civil War, and which has been generally resented by all
armies in the past, has now become second nature to every soldier,
because its value is brought home to him by the most telling kind of
lesson in experience&mdash;death. He puts earth <span class="pagenum"><a id="page068" name="page068"></a>(p. 068)</span> between himself and
the enemy's fire as instinctively as one holds up his hand to ward off a
blow.</p>

<p>In trench fighting all that is exposed of a man firing is his head and
shoulders, which accounts for the high percentage of dead to wounded in
this war. In other wars it has been as one to five; while in this war,
on the western front, it has varied from as one to two and three. If the
trenches are brought extremely close together then either side is safe
from the other's artillery fire, because there is as much danger of
hitting your own trench as the enemy's with your shells. A distance of
20 or 30 yards meant that at any time either side could start in
throwing bombs or grenades by hand across that one definitely neutral
country&mdash;the zone of death between the trenches. Beyond that range up to
the average range, trench mortars which "lobbed" a charge of high
explosive from trench to trench could be used. Thus the war of machinery
became a war of explosives. Anything that could be dropped into the
trench and burst might kill or wound some of the enemy, which meant
debit on their side of the ledger in a war of attrition and exhaustion.
The higher the angle of flight the more likely the charge actually to
fall into the narrow ditch in the earth, instead of breaking its force
against the wall, which accounts for the superiority of the howitzer
with its high angle of flight and shorter range to the gun with its
lower trajectory and longer range.</p>

<p>Thus there can be no limitation to the amount of artillery and the
quantities of explosives serviceable in this kind of warfare. No one of
the armies has ever had anything like enough shells. None ever can. Five
hundred guns of all ranges set back of one another from 3,000 to 20,000
yards' range to a mile could be placed, or 225,000 for the western
front, and they could readily use five million shells a day in this
contest of munitions and manufacturing resources.</p>

<p>All armies had to conserve their ammunition, and in parts of the line,
which were known as "quiet corners," for tactical reasons the stalemate
was almost peaceful, either side holding its fire unless the other
became restless. But between the trenches which had remained in the same
position for many months, no <span class="pagenum"><a id="page069" name="page069"></a>(p. 069)</span> living thing was visible day
after day except a rabbit or a field mouse where the ground birds made
their nests, and there the piping of birds joined with the song of the
bullets. Except for occasional snipers' shots at the sight of anything
moving on the enemy's parapet, the day wore monotonously on&mdash;when to
expose the head for half a minute meant death.</p>

<p>Naturally the trenches do not run straight. They bend in and out at
sharp angles in order to localize the explosions of shells; they are so
narrow in most places that two men can pass with difficulty. A few
soldiers are on guard, the rest may be lying about their dugouts or
probably engaged in building new traverses or in putting up new layers
of sandbags or deepening their dugouts. They become beavers rather than
warriors, day laborers with spade and shovel rather than knights. There
is no marching and countermarching; they have no use for the skirmish
drill or the maneuver ground. Sharpshooters with clamped rifles watch
for a target patiently as fishermen for a bite.</p>

<p>Back from the first line trench runs a winding communication trench, a
foot or more deeper than the average man's height and the turns in its
walls stop any bullets which otherwise might sweep its length in
enfilade. In the reserve trenches are other men in burrows who have not
even the excitement of sniping. They do nothing but wait and dig,
repairing damages wrought by occasional shells on dull days.</p>

<p>At any hour the enemy may suddenly decide to attack and they may find
their houses pounded down about their heads and perhaps half of a
company wiped out in a quarter of an hour. Then other communication
trenches lead back until finally you are in the open country out of the
range of bullets, but not outside the range of shells. Here the munition
caissons and the transport wagons come up by night bringing the food for
men and guns which is taken up to the hungry mouths under the cover of
darkness; and here, on an average day, one will occasionally observe the
passing of an ambulance with its green roof and sides which melts it
into the road and the landscape&mdash;and processions of ambulances when
there is battle. All the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page070" name="page070"></a>(p. 070)</span> detail of army existence is as
precise as that of the best organized industrial plant.</p>

<p>As you walk along you will spy at intervals a hidden battery, perhaps in
a house, perhaps in a hedge, perhaps in a group of trees, perhaps
beautifully roofed over with sod, so that it is invisible from the air.
You rarely look up without seeing an aeroplane flying overhead. When
there is action, you will see many. A faint pur comes out of the heavens
and two planes are seen circling as they exchange bullets from their
machine guns. Another plane is turning to the right and left and ducking
to avoid the thistle blows of smoke which burst from the shrapnel shells
fired by the antiaircraft guns.</p>

<p>Follow the course of the long procession of motor trucks which feed the
army and you arrive at one of the great supply depots which every day
send out the precise quota of supplies that are needed, with every motor
truck having its schedule and keeping that schedule with the accuracy of
a first-class passenger train. Follow the ambulances back from station
to station, where the wounded men are examined to see if they are
suffering from a hemorrhage and whether they are able to stand the
farther journey and do not need an immediate operation, and you are
brought to the immense base hospitals in a closely guarded and well
ordered camp where every sanitary tradition known to modern life is
absolutely enforced. One of these hospitals had twelve thousand beds and
in the offensive of September 25, 1915, it discharged seven thousand
patients in a day.</p>

<p>Soldiers are restricted to the neighborhood of their billets and
officers themselves must have passes if they travel outside the region
occupied by their battalions. Everyone is a policeman under an intricate
system guarding every detail of army secrets from any spy and from those
gallant aviators who risk antiaircraft gunfire in the hope of bringing
home some information to their side.</p>

<p>Never has the Intelligence Service of an army had so many secrets to
guard; never has it required such complicated measures of protection
against espionage. In Napoleonic times, it was enough to know that your
adversary was marching a hundred <span class="pagenum"><a id="page071" name="page071"></a>(p. 071)</span> thousand men along parallel
roads. This your cavalry scouts might discover; or a spy who had crossed
the frontier in an unfrequented place might be watching the enemy's army
and counting his numbers as they passed. Now the frontier is an intact
line of trenches.</p>

<p>The spies of Richelieu's day have been surpassed in this, our day&mdash;with
their stories yet to be told. Many a man who spoke the enemy's language
well has put on the enemy's uniform, joined one of his scouting parties
between the trenches in the darkness, entered the enemy's trenches,
heard all the talk and slipped back to his own lines safely. If
apprehended, his fate was certain&mdash;death.</p>

<p>The most efficient spy, of course, is the one with military training He
knows the value of what he sees. Usually he is an officer of good family
who has been cashiered for gambling or debt and takes a desperate chance
out of patriotism and the hope of atonement. Naturally, the easiest
route for spies was through Holland and Switzerland which became the
gateway of passing spies and the playground of espionage and
counterespionage. Gradually the restrictions tightened for all neutral
travelers from capital to capital, while none were permitted to go into
the zones of the armies, some twenty or thirty miles from the trenches.</p>

<p>The problem of the Intelligence Corps is much like that of putting the
parts of a picture puzzle together. A line from a newspaper in one part
of the world, a line from a newspaper in another taken in connection
with a photograph, an excerpt from a letter found on a prisoner or a
fact got from a prisoner by skillful catechism, might develop a valuable
contributory item. The amount of information procured by either side
about the other was only less amazing to the outsider than how it was
obtained. Again, events revealed amazing ignorance. Most baffling and
most secret of all branches is this, whose work is both gaining and
conserving information, and just as professional, just as carefully
prepared before the war as any other.</p>

<p>A single instance illustrates how small a fact may be of value to the
enemy. A certain well known "military expert" went out to British
headquarters as a guest of a general. From a <span class="pagenum"><a id="page072" name="page072"></a>(p. 072)</span> tower in the
square of a small town, he watched a certain action. When he wrote his
account of it, it was submitted to the general who was his friend; and
the general carelessly passed one little statement which no Chief of
Intelligence of any army would ever have passed and probably no
correspondent of experience would have had the temerity to submit to the
censor unless he wanted to be responsible for the death of men who were
his hosts and his friends. For the writer stated that he saw the battle
from this tower.</p>

<p>Now the London papers reach Holland at four o'clock in the afternoon
where they are seized promptly by the tentacles of the German
Intelligence Service, which did not need to undertake any "picture
puzzle work" on this occasion. It was plain as day that this tower must
be used as an artillery observation post by the enemy. From there he
could see the fall of shells from his batteries and know whether they
were "on" or not. Out of the blue sky the next morning, came a German
artillery concentration which brought the tower down like a house of
cards, and many British soldiers billeted in the neighborhood were
killed or wounded.</p>

<p>In order to deepen the shroud of mystery over his side which baffles the
enemy, many military men would undoubtedly make the press merely the
herald of official bulletins. The British Admiralty carried out this
system to the letter, as a navy may better than an army, in the
resistance of the German submarine campaign. Thus the "Untersee-boots"
came out from Kiel or Zeebrugge and disappeared in the mists of the
North Sea with no message of how they had been destroyed when they never
returned.</p>

<p>The Intelligence Service in common with army transport and the sanitary
service and every other expert branch has for its object the conserving
of the lives of your own soldiers and the taking of those of the enemy,
best expressed by an infantry attack on the enemy's trenches, whether to
gain a few hundred yards or a belt of eight to ten miles as in the case
of the French attack in Champagne in September, 1915, and the German
attack on Verdun in February, 1916. The first step is the concentration
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page073" name="page073"></a>(p. 073)</span> of batteries for artillery preparation. Gradually, these guns
all try out their range with the aeroplanes spotting the fall of their
shells. Then, at the scheduled minute they loose their blasts upon the
front line trenches which are to be taken. In front of the trenches, of
course, are the elaborate barbed-wire entanglements. These are often
twenty, thirty or even forty feet deep. There may be more than one
series of entanglements and some may be screened in some fashion or
other from the effects of artillery fire. Aside from these, <i>trous de
loup</i>, pits with sharpened sticks to impale the invader, and all the
other devices of former times are used&mdash;in short, every obstacle from
the time of Moses to the modern machine gun. No invader can possibly
reach the enemy's trench to contest it with him until these impedimenta
are removed. Thousands of short-cut plans and inventions have been
offered for cleaning away the barbed wire before an attack, but not one
has succeeded because it requires that whoever is to carry out the
suggestion or remove the obstruction, must be submitted to murderous
grilling machine-gun and rifle fire. Shrapnel shells with their sprays
of bullets bursting at a height of a foot above ground remain the
approved method of cutting barbed wire. If the barbed wire is not
destroyed, the men in the charge are "hung up" in it, as the saying is.
Then if a machine gun is still in position in the enemy's trench, they
are riddled with bullets where they lie. No form of death could be more
pitiless or helpless for the soldier than this. He becomes a target on a
spit, as it were.</p>

<p>Granted that the barbed wire is swept away perfectly, no charge can
succeed if many machine guns or rifles from the trenches are playing
upon it. Then men simply rush into a spray of bullets. Therefore, all
the teeth must be drawn from the trench itself. This is done by the
concentration of high-explosive shells from guns of larger caliber,
mostly howitzers, which burst in the earth, tossing up great fountains
of dust, burying and smashing the machine guns and driving all the
operators into their dugouts, where they are sometimes buried alive.</p>

<p>Back of the trench, the guns of smaller caliber which destroy the barbed
wire place a "curtain of fire," as it is called, which <span class="pagenum"><a id="page074" name="page074"></a>(p. 074)</span> does
not permit the enemy to escape from a trench, or any reserves to come to
his assistance. This process is kept up for such a length of time as is
deemed sufficient. At a given moment, the invader charges, often
protected by a screen of smoke which is sent out from his own trenches.</p>

<p>As the burrowers in the earth crawl from the parapets and take to their
legs, they know that their fate is almost altogether dependent upon the
preparation by the guns rather than any effort of their own. Ahead of
them is this wall of smoke and dust from the explosions, in which they
are lost to the observer. Keeping units together and protecting them is
as difficult as maneuvering ships in a fog. The delicate problem of the
gunner is to protect the invader just as far forward as possible,
without putting shells into his own men. A few from defective fuses must
fall short. This is expected and is a part of the cost of a charge; but
none with correct fuses and dependable powder should. The gunners time
their part to that of the invader, by lifting their fire from the first
to the second line trench, as their own men are entering the first.</p>

<p>Granted that the barbed wire is cleared and the men enter the enemy's
trench, they may find themselves struggling over heaps of dust mixed
with the rags of sandbags, splintered timbers and the flesh and uniforms
of their enemy&mdash;at first see not a single adversary. They will be
instantly due for heavy shell fire; and also for heavy machine gun and
rifle fire from the second line enemy trench. They begin to dig at once
in order to establish protection. Out of this wreckage they have to
reverse the enemy's trench, so that it shall face toward him. This
becomes a matter of desperate effort and usually it is in the course of
this that the severest casualties are suffered. But should the artillery
destruction of the trench be imperfect, upon entering it they may still
take the enemy by surprise in his dugouts. In that case, bombs in hand,
at the doorways of these cellars they demand surrender. In case it is
not given, they throw the bombs into the dugout; for, to enter, means
that they will be shot down.</p>

<p>Or, upon entering the trench, they may meet the enemy's soldiers running
out of their dugouts for hand-to-hand battle. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page075" name="page075"></a>(p. 075)</span> The traverses
are so narrow that the length of the rifle makes it a clumsy weapon, and
the adversaries in modern war, whose guns carry twenty miles, engage
hand to hand, using knives, bombs and even their fists. With discarded
rifles and bombs lying about a trench, it is difficult to give quarter.
For a prisoner who is down may pick up a rifle or a bomb and turn on his
captor. It is not human savagery so much as conditions that has made the
fighting so grim. Having established themselves in a certain section or
sections of the trench, naturally the new occupants have the enemy on
their right and left. That is, on one side of one of the winding
traverses will be a German, and say on the other side a Frenchman.
Neither sees the other's head, for both are hidden behind these walls of
earth. If one starts around the corner, it means a bayonet or a bullet
for him.</p>

<p>To gain ground in a trench requires a superior supply of bombs. Any
small package that will contain a high explosive would serve the
purpose. Early in the war, bombs were made out of jam tins and bottles
or any other receptacle which could be filled with an explosive and set
off by a fuse. Later on, different varieties of manufactured bombs in
great quantities appeared. There have been instances of five thousand
being used in a single day over two hundred yards of trench. After
throwing a bomb from the traverse, the offensive follows up the
explosion by rushing along the traverse and catching the defender with a
bayonet while he is <i>hors de combat</i> from the effect of the explosion.
While this orgy&mdash;characteristic of cave dwellers battling on a precipice
in its ferocity&mdash;is proceeding, all is precision at the rear. As the
caissons bring up the supplies of ammunition, the green-curtained motor
ambulances speed on to the hospital with the wounded and the military
police direct the congested traffic and keep watch for spies.</p>


<h4>VITAL LESSONS</h4>

<p>War is force, violence, killing. Whoever tries to disguise its character
is a poor soldier and a poorer citizen. If you would avoid it, and if
you would prepare for it, you must look at it as <span class="pagenum"><a id="page076" name="page076"></a>(p. 076)</span> a fact,
squarely in the face. Never has war been so savage as it is in this most
progressive age in history. We had popular education, aseptic surgery,
the wireless, and antitoxin, but war came nevertheless, and in the wake
of Hague conferences and much preaching of internationalism. It came
when the nations were supposed on account of the press and the telegraph
to have been farther removed from parochialism than ever before, when
more people in every nation in Europe knew the language of their
neighbors than ever in history.</p>

<p>In the cave dweller's time, combatants used a stone hatchet which was
the best weapon that science could produce. To-day by land and sea they
have used all the powers of destruction known to modern man; all the
scientific brains of Europe have been at the disposal of commanders. Yet
no single revolutionary invention has appeared in the course of the war.
The idea of the gas was old. Man already had learned to fly. Guns have
been larger and shells more powerful, but the principle is the same.
Weapons have been further developed, but the types have not changed.</p>

<p>All the essential lessons which the Germans applied they learned in the
Russo-Japanese War. The line of trenches throughout the winter of
1904-05 before Mukden were much the same type as those along the Aisne.
There were trenches in the Civil War and in the Crimea, and in the
American Revolution and in many wars before that. So far as one can
learn, there has not been a single invention by a civilian which would
have been of any use to the British navy in fighting submarines. All
have been devised and applied by naval experts who knew conditions. No
profession is more expert than soldiering and none is older, because it
began when Cain killed Abel.</p>

<p>War being the ultimate resort of force, then the poet, the dreamer, the
scholar, the doctor and the organizer of the arts of peace may succumb
to the bully with the square jaw, the low brow and flesh-tearing
incisors, unless the civilized man uses his resources and talents to
make weapons which are stronger than the bully's fist. This is precisely
what civilization does in order to protect itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page077" name="page077"></a>(p. 077)</span> The two forces which were really prepared for this war were the
British navy and the German army. The British navy has kept command of
the seas and the German army has planted its trenches on foreign soil.
For any nation which is separated from other nations by the sea, the
military lesson of this war is that the sea is the first line of
defense. You will escape bloody trenches at home if you never allow an
enemy to land. He cannot land until he has driven your navy off the
seas.</p>

<p>The other lesson is that a nation should know its method of defense and
have it as complete, practicable and ready as the German army and
British navies were. For three or four years, the Belgians saw the
Germans constructing railroad sidings at Aix and making their
preparations for the blow they struck. Yet the Belgians did not
modernize their forts, or adequately strengthen their army for defense.
If to the staffs of England and France war seemed inevitable, their
governments refused to be convinced.</p>

<p>Any nation which is considering preparedness for national defense must
have a national policy. It must know what it is going to defend and how
it is going to defend it. The British navy was built for the specific
problem of either defeating the German navy in battle or keeping it fast
in its lair. The German army was organized for the purpose of the
invasion of France and then of Russia; the French army for defense from
Germany.</p>

<p>Their efficiency was not the result of the expenditure of money, for
money will not buy defense. It requires training, organization, and
patriotism, and courage, which are not for sale in the market places of
mankind.</p>

<p>Until this war the opinion among English-speaking peoples was universal
that the volunteer system was the best method of recruiting. This on the
principle that the man who offers himself to fight, fights better than
the one who is called to arms by government order. Thus England raised
3,000,000 men. But to a man who has lived much with armies, it seems an
immoral method; it means hiring men to fight for you. One man's life is
just as valuable to him as another's. It is the final sacrifice
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page078" name="page078"></a>(p. 078)</span> which he makes for the defense of his country or his home. He
should make it himself and not ask others to make it for him. Those who
should be the first into battle are the men of wealth, of position, the
favored ones. They owe their country more than the others, because their
country has done more for them.</p>

<p>The courage which every Continental army has exhibited has forever
destroyed the idea that universal service weakens the valor of an army.
Millionaire and peasant, nobleman and workman fighting side by side in
the ranks, and doing all the drudgery of the trenches in common, develop
a democracy which means that a man appreciates his fellow man for his
own sake.</p>

<p>The old idea that wars must be frequent in order to keep up a nation's
virility has also been disproved. Universal service both in France and
Germany through forty years of peace, had been an important influence in
the better physical development of the race, which led to the fortitude,
precision, and courage exhibited. At the same time, a realization of the
seriousness of war on the part of all men, because they knew before this
war began the punishing effect of rifle or machine-gun and artillery
fire, is a powerful deterrent to making war in any spasm of emotion.</p>

<p>There is no more glory, there is no more sport to war. It has become
scientific, businesslike, and commonplace. Never has an unprepared
nation been so helpless against the prepared as to-day. The American
Revolution could never have been won by untrained levies to-day against
the British regulars if they possessed modern weapons. Our forefathers
had their fowling pieces, taken from the walls in the days when the
cannon fired a solid shot for a few hundred yards, and there were few
cannon; and so far as weapons were concerned, they were almost on a
level with their enemy, the enemy's only superiority being that of their
drill and organization. Now the enemy would have guns and rifles which
it takes many months to make, even if you have the plants.</p>

<p>In an era of sanitation and bodily cleanliness and popular education, it
has been shown that far from men having lost their virility, they fought
far better than the so-called "strong" and primitive man, and those
soldiers of former ages who "drank <span class="pagenum"><a id="page079" name="page079"></a>(p. 079)</span> hard six days a week and
fought like the devil on Sunday" and would look down upon this age as
effeminate. Physically, mentally, and morally, the soldiers who sprang
to arms in the beginning of this war were superior unquestionably to any
soldiers who have ever gone into any war in Europe. They had more skill,
more courage, more determination. Their pride was greater, and that
alone made them more gallant. Those who wanted to know what war was
like, to have the experience of their first baptism of fire, soon had it
in the swift processes of mobilization and attack. Then, in their
stubbornness, they settled down to the long, grim business of seeing
through a task that was begun. The trenches were the last places where
you would hear the advocacy of war as war. There the sentiment was
simply of duty that must go on until a decision was reached.</p>

<p>Never has war been more savagely fought, possibly because the modern
mind reasons that war being force and violence and killing, this
principle should be applied to the limit. Yet never have the wounded
been so tenderly cared for, never has the hospital organization been so
complete. Never probably in the history of European warfare have
prisoners, once they were taken, been so well treated. In other wars
100,000 survivors or so returned home when the struggle was over. Here
millions will go. Every home will either have its dead hero or its
living veteran. These are the men who will rule Europe in the future.
Behind the lines, among the civilian population, the war has acted as a
scourge. It has submerged self into the whole. Fatty degeneration of the
heart of the body politic has been cut away to the muscle.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>





<h2 class="b1"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page083" name="page083"></a>(p. 083)</span> THE THEATRES OF THE WAR'S CAMPAIGNS<br>

<span class="smaller smcap">By F. H. SIMONDS</span></h2>


<p class="title">MAIN MILITARY FEATURES</p>

<p>The purpose of this review is to summarize briefly the main military
phases of the first year and a half of the Great War. To do this it is
perhaps simplest to accept the unity supplied by the three major
campaigns of the Central Powers, that of Germany against France, that of
Austria and Germany against Russia, and that of Germany, Austria, and
Bulgaria against Serbia.</p>

<p>There is no intention of discussing here any ethical or political
considerations. Certain historical details are, however, of real
interest and value. Thus it is worth while to recall that the present
conflict differs little, if at all, from the earlier coalition wars of
Europe, in which one nation, numerically weaker, has sought to impose
its will upon a group of nations collectively larger, richer, and
potentially capable of employing greater numbers of men. In a word, the
present war is a pretty accurate repetition of the wars of Louis XIV and
Napoleon I, with Germany playing the French rôle.</p>

<p>Now in such struggles it had always been true, and German writers,
notably Bernhardi, insisted it would be true of any future war, that the
single chance for a decisive victory for the smaller nation lay in
crushing the several foes before they were able to get their collective
strength in the field, while the superior preparedness, training,
general military efficiency of the smaller nation still enabled it to
put the superior numbers at the decisive point at the crucial moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page084" name="page084"></a>(p. 084)</span> This whole conception is made perfectly clear by a glance at
the familiar and classic parallel of the Napoleonic wars. In 1805
Napoleon, facing a European coalition, which included Russia, Great
Britain, and Austria, and was bound to enlist Prussia ultimately, quite
as the present anti-German group enlisted Italy, had to solve the same
military problem.</p>

<p>Consider what he did. Breaking his camp at Boulogne, which he left in
September, 1805, he sent his Grand Army into southern Germany and
against Ulm. On October 20 he captured Mack's army at Ulm. On December 2
he routed the Austrian and Russian armies at Austerlitz, and on December
26 there was signed the Treaty of Pressburg, which eliminated Austria
from the war. Prussia now intervening, he destroyed the Prussian armies
at Jena and Auerstädt on October 14, 1806. In June, 1807, he completed
his task by defeating the Russians at Friedland. The Peace of Tilsit,
which followed immediately, removed Russia and Prussia from the fighting
line, as Austria had already been removed. Between the capitulation of
Ulm and the victory of Friedland there intervened nineteen months. More
than eighteen have now passed since the fall of Liege in the present
war.</p>

<p>The Peace of Tilsit made Napoleon the master of Europe with only Great
Britain left in the field against him. The subsequent military and
political history which led to Napoleon's downfall has no pertinence in
the present discussion. What it is essential to recognize is that the
German high command in August, 1914, approached a Napoleonic problem in
the Napoleonic fashion.</p>

<p>In German quarters there had been before the war, and there has been
since, a debate as to the comparative advantage of making the first
campaign against France or against Russia. The fact that the attack on
France failed has doubtless contributed to strengthen the case of those
who held the view of the elder Moltke and advocated an eastern
offensive. But this is merely an academic discussion. What is of
interest to us now is to recognize that Germany did decide to attack
France, that she did direct against the republic the first and
necessarily the greatest blow <span class="pagenum"><a id="page085" name="page085"></a>(p. 085)</span> she could deliver. It was not
until April, 1915, that she actually undertook an attack upon Russia,
and then the prospect of a decisive victory, on the Napoleonic order,
had practically disappeared.</p>


<h4>THE ATTACK UPON FRANCE</h4>

<p>Turning now to the first campaign, the attack upon France, it is to be
recognized at the outset that the German purpose was to dispose of
France in the military sense for the period of the war by a campaign
that should repeat the success of 1870. It was essential that this
victory should be achieved before France could profit by Russian
activity in the east and before Great Britain could render material
military assistance to her French ally. It was equally essential that
the blow should be so swift and heavy that it would crush the French
before they could equip and organize their great reserves, for whom,
thanks to legislative folly and pacifist agitation, there was lacking
equipment and arms.</p>

<p>For the accomplishment of this great task, Germany counted upon her
superior numbers, the greater speed of her mobilization, and the excess
of her population over France to give her a decisive advantage. She
counted also upon her advantage in heavy artillery and machine guns, on
her organization of motor transport, which was to establish new records
in invasion. Only in field artillery, in the now famous "seventy-fives,"
could France claim any advantage.</p>

<p>In 1870 Sedan had come four weeks after the first German troops had
entered France. For the new campaign the Germans allowed six weeks. For
this time German high command reckoned that Russia could be mobilized in
the east, and that any incidental Russian success in East Prussia or
Silesia would be counterbalanced by the tremendous victories to be won
in northern France. Paris itself would be a sufficient counterprize for
Posen, Breslau, or Cracow.</p>

<p>The time limit, however, imposed certain other conditions. The
Franco-German frontier from Luxemburg to Switzerland had been
transformed into one long barrier, garnished with detached <span class="pagenum"><a id="page086" name="page086"></a>(p. 086)</span>
forts and resting upon the first-class fortresses of Verdun, Toul,
Epinal, and Belfort. To pierce such a barrier was not impossible but to
break through in three weeks, with the whole French army before the
forts and the shortness of the front offering the Germans no opportunity
to take advantage of their superior numbers, was recognized as next to
impossible.</p>

<p>There was left the roads through Belgium and Luxemburg. To come this way
Germany had for more than a decade been constructing strategic railways
leading from the Rhine and Moselle valleys to the Belgian frontier,
double-track roads that served in a desolate country, but were provided
with all the necessary machinery for detraining thousands of soldiers.</p>

<p>Belgium might not consent to suffer this invasion of her territory but
the Belgian army was negligible, and the German heavy artillery was
known to be adequate to dispose of the antiquated forts of Namur and
Liege with brief delay. Once the Germans had passed the Meuse and
deployed upon the Belgian plain, they could turn south and pass the
Franco-Belgian frontier, which was destitute of real defenses, the few
fortresses being obsolete, and thence the road ran down to Paris clear
and open.</p>

<p>Conceivably Great Britain might make the Belgian invasion a cause for
joining France. But, again, the British army was small, there was the
gravest doubt as to whether it would be sent to the Continent at all,
and even if it came, it would not redress the balance between the French
and German armies. Such being the case, as German high command saw it,
Belgium was summoned, and refusing, was attacked, the German armies
passing the Belgian frontier in the direction of Liege on August 4,
1914, the day on which Germany declared war upon France, and the
forty-fourth anniversary of the invasion of France in the
Franco-Prussian War.</p>


<h4>FROM THE MEUSE TO THE MARNE</h4>

<p>To grasp the main circumstances of the opening campaign it is simplest
to think of the whole German invading forces as comprising one army. The
right of this army under Kluck and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page087" name="page087"></a>(p. 087)</span> Bülow came west through
Belgium by Brussels and Namur, swinging south after the Belgians were
disposed of, and leaving a guard to curtain the Belgian army which had
retreated on Antwerp. The center moved southwest through the Belgian
Ardennes and Luxemburg, entering France between Longwy and Givet on the
Meuse. The left moved from Metz and Strassburg, attempting to force the
French barrier line between Toul and Epinal. The center was commanded by
the German Crown Prince, Albert of Württemberg, and Hausen, the left by
the Crown Prince of Bavaria and Heeringen. Smaller forces operating in
Upper Alsace played little real part in the operations.</p>

<p>Taking up first the German right: It did not begin its real advance
until August 12, 1914. Liege had been captured on August 7, the last
fort fell on August 15. Meantime the Germans pushed a heavy screen of
cavalry forward, and there was steady skirmishing between Liege and
Brussels, which was magnified into battles and German defeats. In point
of fact, the Belgian army was rapidly pushed back, and once the main
German advance began, it fled to Antwerp.</p>

<p>Kluck took Brussels on August 18, 1914, and turned south, meeting the
first serious resistance at Mons. Bülow, moving across the Meuse at Huy,
took Namur on August 23, 1914, and his troops fought at Charleroi, while
those of Hausen forced a passage of the Meuse south of Namur. The French
were beaten at Charleroi, and the British while the battle of Mons was
still undecided, were forced to retreat, because Bülow's success in
taking Namur had imperiled the whole allied left flank.</p>

<p>Because he delayed his retreat too long, Sir John French was immediately
threatened with destruction, Kluck having succeeded in getting on his
flank, while sending superior numbers against his front. For a week
there was grave danger that the Germans would be able to destroy the
British and intervene between the French left and the city of Paris. At
Cambrai on the 25th, British destruction seemed imminent, but the
British just managed to win clear, and French troops coming up on their
exposed flank by September 1, they were safe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page088" name="page088"></a>(p. 088)</span> The French center had essayed an offensive into the Ardennes at
the moment the battle of Charleroi was beginning. In this they did not
succeed, and the Fourth Army under Langle de Cary fell back in perfect
order from the Belgian-Luxemberg frontier across the Meuse near Sedan,
where they held their line until the general retreat began. Henceforth
the French armies from left to right were not seriously threatened until
the final struggle at the Marne.</p>

<p>But the right under De Castelnau had been obliged to retreat. It had
opened the campaign by a series of victories which had carried the main
force into German Lorraine as far as Saarburg on the railroad from Metz
to Strassburg. To the south Mülhausen had been taken, lost, and
recaptured. But in the third week of August the main army encountered
strong forces in the region of Morhange and fell back on Nancy, the
frontier town of Lunéville being momentarily occupied by the Germans. At
Nancy it stood. But its stand was one of the important battles of the
western war and a contributory cause to the subsequent victory at the
Marne. By this victory the eastern barrier was held and the German
effort to isolate Verdun and Toul blocked. Some of the most terrible
fighting of the war took place here, and the Germans, fighting under the
eye of the kaiser suffered colossal losses.</p>

<p>In the last days of August Joffre had to make his great decision. His
right was holding before Nancy, and was soon to make a successful
advance, clearing most of eastern Lorraine. His center, stretched across
the Champagne country from the Argonne to the Oise, had recovered from
early reverses and won several considerable local counteroffenses,
notably at Guise. But his left was still shaky, his reserves were not
yet up and his reconcentration was incomplete. Should he risk all now,
or take his army back until his left rested upon Paris? To do this
latter would be to surrender more French territory, but it would mean a
further exhaustion of the Germans, a further increase in his numbers.
The morale of his troops was unshaken. He had suffered defeats, but
merely incidental defeats, the real test had not yet come.</p>

<h4><span class="pagenum"><a id="page089" name="page089"></a>(p. 089)</span> THE BATTLE OF THE MARNE</h4>

<p>Joffre decided to continue his retreat, and took his army south of the
Marne, his left formed by the British resting upon the forts of Paris,
behind which he had massed a new army, his center stretching between
Paris and Verdun, his right along the barrier line from Verdun to
Switzerland. The German armies, already worn down by their exertions and
their losses, were now to be attacked by their foe, whom they regarded
as already vanquished.</p>

<p>The first phase of the Battle of the Marne was fought northeast of Paris
along the Ourcq, which gives its name to the local battle. Kluck had
marched past the French capital, going south along its eastern front and
leaving only small guards to cover his rear and flank. He had before him
the British and on his flank the new Paris army, of the existence of
which he was totally ignorant. In Joffre's strategy this army was to
strike east while the British struck north, together they were to act
like the two blades of a pair of scissors. Between them Kluck was to be
destroyed and his rout would expose the flank and rear of all the German
forces in France.</p>

<p>The French struck with great promptness, but the British failed to move
quickly enough. Kluck extricated himself from between the blades with
supreme generalship, brought his main force back against the French,
borrowing a corps from Bülow and presently the French were driven back
upon Paris. British slowness had wrecked the master stroke of Joffre's
strategy.</p>

<p>But in the center the situation was changing. Joffre had issued his
famous order to attack upon September 5. The Paris army under Manoury
had struck on the 6th, and the French offensive had steadily
communicated itself from west to east along the whole line, that is, to
the British army, then to the armies of Franchet d'Espérey, of Foch, of
De Langle de Cary, of Sarrail. In the French center about September 9,
General Foch, commanding still another new army, had begun his attack.
By a combination of operations, which remain the most brilliant of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page090" name="page090"></a>(p. 090)</span> the war, he flung a portion of the Germans before him into the
marshes of St. Gond and routed the remainder. In this field the Germans
now began a retreat which was almost a rout. Meantime, further to the
east, Sarrail, holding Verdun, had begun to attack the crown prince, who
was in difficulty.</p>

<p>Foch's success was decisive, Kluck and Bülow began their retreat,
leaving their own fights undecided. Hausen, who faced Foch, was removed
in disgrace, and his army now in bad shape, went back to Châlons and
then to the Rheims-Argonne district. The crown prince with difficulty
drew his forces out of the lower Argonne and north of Verdun. The French
victory in Lorraine had also become absolute, and the Germans were back
on the frontier.</p>

<p>But there was lacking to the French the numbers and the strength to make
their victory conclusive. They had been outnumbered at the moment of
victory, their twenty-two corps facing twenty-seven at the Marne,
900,000 at most against 1,200,000. The fall of Maubeuge had released
fresh German troops, who came south, and, reenforcing Kluck, enabled him
to stand at the Aisne. The German front was reconstituted, running from
the Oise at Noyon to Metz and the deadlock was about to begin, had in
fact begun.</p>

<p>The remainder of the western campaign requires little comment. There now
followed that operation, well described as "the race to the sea." The
French coming east around the right flank of the Germans north of Noyon
attempted to reach their rear at St. Quentin and turn them out of
France. The Germans endeavored to extend their line westward to the sea
and thus secure their flank and, in addition, take possession of the
whole French coast from the mouth of the Somme to Belgium.</p>

<p>Neither side succeeded. Instead a line was erected from the Oise due
north to the German Ocean at Nieuport, which became the new battle
front. Antwerp fallen, the Germans made a supreme effort to shorten and
straighten their line by attacking the French, British, and Belgians,
who held the extreme left of the allied forces between Nieuport and La
Bassée, along the Yser and about Ypres. This struggle lasted for nearly
a month, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page091" name="page091"></a>(p. 091)</span> and was desperate in the extreme. For the British it
was a gigantic repetition of Waterloo, and they were again asked to hold
a position, not now for hours, but for days, under heavy pressure, and
in the face of odds such as Napoleon did not possess in the earlier
conflict. In the end the line held, German approach to the Channel was
blocked, and by December 1 the western war had dropped to trench
fighting which still persists along the lines that had been
substantially occupied in November, 1914.</p>


<h4>GERMAN FAILURE</h4>

<p>Such briefly was the history of the first German venture, the effort to
dispose of France. So far as its main object was concerned it failed
absolutely. It failed because Joffre met the German thrust with a parry
which turned it aside. French military power was not destroyed, it was
not even shaken. France was not eliminated by a crushing defeat as
Austria had been eliminated at Austerlitz in a similar conflict.</p>

<p>The victory had been won because Joffre had deliberately held his forces
in hand and avoided a decisive issue, until he had brought the Germans
to his own battle field. He had avoided a German net which might have
encircled a portion of his armies, as Bazaine had been encircled at
Metz; he had declined to consider political conditions and fight as
MacMahon had been compelled to fight at Sedan. With inferior numbers,
with smaller resources in heavy artillery and transport, with a handicap
of inferior subordinates, who in Alsace and in the Ardennes, as well as
at Charleroi, had by their incompetence imperiled his first plans, he
had won a campaign. That the success was not conclusive cannot be
charged to him, Sir John French's failure along the Grand Morin, as
other critics assert, or Manoury's excess of zeal at the Ourcq, by
enabling Kluck to avoid Joffre's embrace, possibly saved the Germans
from a general disaster.</p>

<p>The Battle of the Marne denied Germany the continental supremacy which
Austerlitz prepared for Napoleon. It saved France, gave Great Britain
time to raise her volunteer armies, mobilize her industries. To win it
France had put in her last <span class="pagenum"><a id="page092" name="page092"></a>(p. 092)</span> ounce of available strength, and
there was needed for her, too, time to reorganize her armies, and
prepare to conduct a long war. She was not able and she has not yet been
able to turn Germany out of that twenty-fifth of French area, which
Germany holds, and has held since October, 1914.</p>

<p>But in every sense this Battle of the Marne was one of the few really
decisive battles of all human history. It was a French victory,
organized by French genius and won by French soldiers. The British
contribution was slight, just as the British numbers were insignificant.
It was not due to Belgian resistance, as has been so frequently asserted
in the past, and the determining phase was the wonderful fight of Foch
at Champenoise, after the Paris army had failed against Kluck.</p>


<h4>AGAINST RUSSIA</h4>

<p>The character of the German operations against Russia in the opening
days of the war was determined by the decision to attack France.
Necessarily all troops save that minimum which represented the barest
margin of safety were sent to the west and there was left to a small
force the duty of defending the East Prussian marshes. Germany counted
upon the slowness of Russian mobilization to give her six weeks of
immunity on her eastern frontier. She expected in that time to dispose
of France, and she believed that at the end of it Russia would still be
engaged in concentrating her masses. Both calculations were wrong.</p>

<p>But the main reliance of Germany in the east was Austria, whose whole
force, save for one or two corps borrowed by Germany to defend Alsace
and four corps sent against Serbia, was available for the invasion of
Russian Poland. If Austria could organize a resistance that would last
for six weeks, Germany was prepared to do the rest. This she expected of
Austria, and again her calculations were wrong.</p>

<p>A glance at the map serves to explain the opening moves in the eastern
campaign. Russian Poland projects into Austro-German territory, and is
nearly encircled by German East Prussia and Austrian Galicia. Russian
mobilization had therefore <span class="pagenum"><a id="page093" name="page093"></a>(p. 093)</span> to take place not at the frontier,
but behind the Vistula and the armies, once concentrated, advanced from
the Niemen, west of Kovno, from Warsaw, from Brest-Litovsk on the Bug
and from the Rowno-Dubno-Lutsk fortresses west of Kiev. Thus the
military as contrasted with the political frontier of Russia was behind
the Vistula, the Niemen and the Bug.</p>

<p>The Austro-German plan contemplated a defensive fight on the north, in
East Prussia, and an offensive campaign from the south, aimed at Lublin
and Brest-Litovsk. The Russians on their side planned an immediate
invasion of East Prussia from Warsaw and Kovno and a far more
considerable offensive into Galicia from the Rumanian boundary to Rowno.
The objective of the northern operation was the conquest of the whole of
Prussia east of the Vistula, that of the southern the capture of Lemberg
and the conquest of all Galicia. Combined, these two movements would
abolish the Polish salient and give the Russian right flank the
protection of the Baltic, the left the cover of the Carpathians. Only
then could there be any safe advance by the center through Poland upon
Posen and Breslau and thence upon Berlin.</p>

<p>Russian mobilization was more rapid than Russia's allies could have
hoped for and it wholly confounded the Germans. While the Battle of the
Marne was still two weeks off Russian forces were sweeping west from the
Niemen and approaching Königsberg, a second army was striking north from
Warsaw. East Prussian populations were fleeing before the invaders and a
German disaster seemed imminent.</p>

<p>The genius of Hindenburg, who now appeared upon the eastern battle
ground, saved the situation. Gathering in all his available forces and
leaving the Russian army coming from the Niemen almost unopposed, he
caught the Warsaw army in the swamps about the frontier in the last days
of August and, thanks to his generalship and heavy artillery, destroyed
a Russian army. Tannenberg was a great victory and it saved East
Prussia. The Niemen army had to retreat rapidly to escape destruction.
At the time, it was asserted that the Russian invasion had compelled the
Germans to draw upon their western <span class="pagenum"><a id="page094" name="page094"></a>(p. 094)</span> front to meet the thrust
and thus to weaken their armies in advance of the decisive battle. This
is not now believed to be true, but there is no doubt that it drew
reserves who might otherwise have gone to the west or to the south.</p>

<p>Tannenberg was a victory which filled the world with its splendor, but
it merely disguised for the moment the far more considerable Austrian
disaster to the south. One Austrian army had crossed the frontier and
approached Lublin, another had advanced east from Lemberg. Upon the
Lemberg army the full weight of the Russian thrust now fell and the army
was promptly routed, driven through Lemberg and west of the San or
across the Carpathians. The force that had approached Lublin was thus
left in the air and succumbed to a series of disasters, which culminated
in the terrible defeat of Rawa-Ruska. Meantime the Austrian troops,
which had invaded Serbia were routed in the Battle of the Jedar, which
preceded the other Austrian disasters and was, in fact, the first
considerable triumph for the Allies in the whole war.</p>


<h4>AUSTRIAN PERIL</h4>

<p>Austria was now in dire straits and her whole military structure seemed
on the point of crumbling. Russian armies flowed west through Galicia
and approached Tarnow, Przemysl was isolated, tens of thousands of
prisoners, innumerable guns and vast quantities of stores fell to the
victors. While the great German attack upon France was failing, Russia
seemed on the point of achieving against Germany's ally what Germany had
failed to achieve against France.</p>

<p>Germany was now compelled to intervene. At the moment when she was
organizing her final effort in the west and sending her best troops to
hack their way to Calais, she had to divert other troops to the east.
Hindenburg undertook a new offensive, this time from the Silesian
frontier, and pushed with great rapidity to the very suburbs of Warsaw.
He only failed by a narrow margin, Siberian troops coming up just in
time to save the Polish capital, and Hindenburg, now outnumbered,
conducted a swift <span class="pagenum"><a id="page095" name="page095"></a>(p. 095)</span> and orderly retreat to the frontier. But his
intervention had disorganized the Russian campaign in Galicia and
Russian armies there had been compelled to retreat and send
reenforcements north.</p>

<p>Hindenburg's retreat was a signal for a fresh Russian advance, this time
the czar's forces reached the gates of Cracow and began to crowd through
the Carpathian passes and sweep down into the Hungarian Plain. Przemysl
was again invested, Russian troops for the first time entering German
territory west of the Vistula. It was necessary for Germany to intervene
again.</p>

<p>This time Hindenburg was more successful. He had retreated upon Cracow
and Breslau; gathering up his armies he transported them rapidly to the
north by strategic railways, brought them back into Poland south of the
Vistula, interposed between the Russians and Warsaw and very nearly
repeated at Lodz his great success of Tannenberg. But this time the
Russians after desperate fighting won clear, and fell back to the lines
in front of Warsaw, which they were to hold for so many months. At the
same time they retreated in Galicia from before Cracow to Tarnow and
stood behind the Dunajec River. Austria was saved again, but having, in
her extreme peril recalled some of her corps from an army engaged in a
new invasion of Serbia, that army was routed and well-nigh destroyed.</p>


<h4>GERMANY'S SECOND OFFENSIVE</h4>

<p>From December to April the eastern campaign lacked decisive
circumstances. In the north Hindenburg won a new and splendid victory at
the Mazurian Lakes, expelling a Russian army which had renewed the
invasion of East Prussia. In the south the Russians steadily pushed the
Austrians back into the Carpathians, took Przemysl with more than
125,000 prisoners, and as spring came seemed on the point of crowning
the Carpathians and descending into the Hungarian Plain.</p>

<p>But the Germans were already organizing their second great offensive.
They were raising new armies, collecting fresh stores <span class="pagenum"><a id="page096" name="page096"></a>(p. 096)</span> of
ammunition and preparing for a thrust against Russia as gigantic as that
against France, with the deliberate purpose of eliminating Russia from
the war. There was no longer any chance of a Napoleonic success in
Europe. But if Russia were eliminated, they could still hope to win a
peace that might leave them Belgium. Some portion of their plans was
spoiled almost as the spring campaign opened, by the entrance of Italy
on the Allies' side, but Italy came too late to save Russia from the
disasters that had begun.</p>

<p>The German plan of campaign was simple. Hindenburg was to strike east
and south from East Prussia at the Russian lines along the
Niemen-Bobr-Narew. Mackensen, having pushed the Russians out of Galicia,
was to strike north through Lublin and toward Brest-Litovsk. A new army
was to invade Courland and aim at Riga. It was the German hope that the
main Russian masses would be caught and enveloped by Hindenburg and
Mackensen, that Poland would be taken and all its garrisons, and the
bulk of the Russian military power be destroyed.</p>

<p>The first blow fell at Gorlice in Galicia in the last days of April.
Mackensen, furnished with the greatest train of artillery war had ever
seen, burst through the Russian lines along the Dunajec, destroyed
Dmitrieff's army, which faced him, almost captured the Russian
Carpathian forces and drove the Russians rapidly beyond the San, retook
first Przemysl and then Lemberg, thus clearing all but a corner of
Galicia.</p>

<p>The main German and Austrian armies were then sent north toward
Brest-Litovsk, while Hindenburg began his thrust by attacking Ossowetz
and the Niemen-Bobr-Narew barrier of forts. By this time the world knew
that Russian ammunition had failed and for many weeks the possibility of
a tremendous Russian disaster existed. Step by step the Russians were
pushed back. The fall of Warsaw was assured in July and it was not until
August that the escape of the Russian garrison was certain. The same
problem was raised about Kovno and Brest-Litovsk, but again the Russians
won clear. Late in August the final net of the Germans about Vilna was
drawn, but for the last time the Russians eluded it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page097" name="page097"></a>(p. 097)</span> And with the battle of Vilna the German eastern campaign
practically ends. In the north the Russians held Riga and the Dwina
line, in the center they were behind the great marshes of Pinsk, to the
south they were behind the Styr and Stripa, still holding Rowno, still
clinging to a corner of Galicia. They had lost hundreds of thousands of
prisoners and many guns. All of Russian Poland, most of Courland, and
much other territory had been surrendered. But they had kept their
armies intact and were once more in line.</p>

<p>In so far as the German campaign had been designed to free Austrian soil
and relieve the pressure upon Austrian and German fronts in the east, it
had been a shining success. It had served, too, to restore German
prestige in the Balkans. But it had come too late to keep Italy out, and
it had not eliminated Russia.</p>

<p>Unless the Germans were prepared to repeat the fatal Napoleonic march
upon Moscow, there was now nothing for them to do but abandon their
eastern campaign for the winter, to dig in and hold until the spring
permitted new operations. But this offered to the Russians a period of
recuperation and rest. In the spring they would have new armies and
fresh artillery. These circumstances were the measure of the German
failure in their second offensive. In their first they had set out to
dispose of France and had suffered defeat at the Marne. In the second
they had undertaken to put Russia out, and after a long series of
victories, Russia had escaped and was now beyond their grasp.</p>

<p>From the military point of view the Russian failure was even more
serious than the French, because it came a year later, and at the hour
when the superior numbers and resources of the enemies of Germany were
already beginning to tell.</p>


<h4>THE THIRD GERMAN OFFENSIVE</h4>

<p>The two preceding German campaigns had been based on purely military
considerations. The first was a true Napoleonic conception designed to
grasp a Napoleonic opportunity. The second was partly imposed upon
Germany by Russian success and Austrian failure. There was no longer a
question of destroying <span class="pagenum"><a id="page098" name="page098"></a>(p. 098)</span> the opponents in order, it was a
question of eliminating one and then finding a basis for peace with the
others. The third German campaign, that in the Balkans, was political
quite as much as it was military. It was designed to provide Germany
with some profit for her great sacrifices and her great losses, but it
was no longer a question of the conquest of any considerable foe.</p>

<p>By the operations of British sea power, Germany had now practically lost
her colonial empire. It was certain that with peace she would not again
be permitted to make use of British colonies or ports, as she had done
before. Her overseas commerce with belligerents and their colonies was
bound to be ruined, even if peace came soon, for the period of the war
it was, of course, abolished.</p>

<p>The entrance of Turkey on the German side had opened for the Germans a
new field for industrial exploitation, if there could once be opened a
road from the Danube to Constantinople. This field would be beyond the
reach of sea power. Once Germany had taken actual command at
Constantinople, once the railroad from Hamburg to the Bosphorus was
open, it was possible to threaten Britain in Egypt, and perhaps
ultimately in India by the Bagdad and Mecca railways.</p>

<p>Such a threat, coupled with one more successful campaign, might exercise
a decisive influence upon the minds of the people of the allied
countries, and in opening a road to the Golden Horn, Germany might find
the path to peace. Already there was apparent willingness in Berlin to
evacuate Belgium and northern France, only from Russia did Germany now
insist upon tribute in the form of conquered provinces. But until the
road to Constantinople was open, until the Serbian nuisance was
abolished, peace could not be considered.</p>

<p>Turkey, too, was calling for aid. Early in the year the Anglo-French
fleets had tried to force the Dardanelles. Their failure had been
followed by a land attack at Gallipoli, which had so far failed, but
Turkish ammunition and artillery was inadequate for a sustained fight,
and there was needed German aid. To lose the Dardanelles was to see
Turkey conquered, Russia provided <span class="pagenum"><a id="page099" name="page099"></a>(p. 099)</span> with munitions, and the
whole German dream of expansion to Asia Minor destroyed.</p>

<p>It was necessary, too, to provide the German people with a new victory.
They had been bitterly disappointed that the Russian campaign had not
brought peace, or, at the least, the elimination of Russia. A new and
relatively cheap success, the conquest of the Balkans, would fire their
imagination and again stimulate their hopes for a victorious peace. In
addition, Bulgaria now beckoned to the Germans. Her army was at the
disposition of the two kaisers, but there was plain peril that if the
coming were too long delayed, the Allies might succeed in persuading
Ferdinand to cast his lot with the camp that now offered him Serbian
Macedonia and Turkish Thrace, and were suggesting the further
<i>pourboire</i> of Greek Kavala.</p>

<p>Accordingly Germany decided to go south, having gone west and east
without finding peace or decisive victory. She had available for this
operation troops no longer needed against Russia since the campaign on
this front had died out, and she had to command it, the great Mackensen,
whose fame now rivaled that of Hindenburg, whose victories had regained
Galicia. "Constantinople and Peace" became the new German watchword,
just as "Paris and Peace" and "Warsaw and Peace" had been in preceding
months.</p>

<p>And at the outset of this third campaign it is perhaps appropriate to
point out that Germany was now to achieve that complete military success
that had been denied to her in France and Russia, she was to win a
victory in the military sense which was beyond cavil, but she was this
time to lose the political profit she had hoped, because she had
mistaken the importance in the minds of her enemies of the Balkan field
and fatally overestimated the war weariness of the peoples that opposed
her. At the Golden Horn she was to find not peace, but the necessity for
new campaigns.</p>


<h4><span class="pagenum"><a id="page100" name="page100"></a>(p. 100)</span> THE SERBIAN PHASE</h4>

<p>On the military side the Serbian campaign was the simplest of
operations. For many months the Serbian forces had been posted south of
the Danube and the Save and east of the Drin, looking over their
frontiers into Hungary and Bosnia. Behind them from the Danube at
Belgrade to the Ægean at Saloniki ran the Orient railroad, by which they
were munitioned. At Nish halfway to the sea, the line drew near to the
Bulgarian frontier and sent a branch off, which passed through Bulgaria
and reached Constantinople.</p>

<p>The Saloniki railway was the life line of Serbia, it was also the
natural route for a retreat, if the Austro-German attack became too
heavy. But it was fatally exposed, should Bulgaria enter the war against
Serbia. In the Treaty of Bucharest, Greece and Rumania had undertaken to
join Serbia should she be attacked by Bulgaria, and the mission of
Greece was to cover the Saloniki railroad as far north as it was
necessary to join hands with the Serbians.</p>

<p>Now, while the Bulgarians were beginning to mobilize and the
Austro-German hosts were gathering to the north, Serbia appealed to her
former allies to keep their agreement. Both declined, and their refusal
was fatal. The Allies had relied upon Greek promises, and had failed to
collect any considerable force at Saloniki. They had trusted Bulgaria
and refused to let Serbia attack her neighbor before Bulgarian
mobilization was complete. Once Bulgaria had mobilized the doom of
Serbia was settled.</p>

<p>What happened was this: The Germans forced the passage of the Danube
north and east of Belgrade and came south along the broad Morava River
Valley, driving the Serbs before them. Thanks to the heavy artillery of
the invaders Serbian resistance was impotent. The Austrians, meantime,
crossed the Drin and came east from Bosnia. Think of Serbia as a
rectangle and you can visualize two sides of the figure as closing in on
the center, which was the heart of Serbia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page101" name="page101"></a>(p. 101)</span> At the appointed moment the Bulgarians struck west from a third
side of the rectangle, speedily crossed the Belgrade-Nish-Saloniki
railroad, and thus cut off the true line of Serbian retreat, that upon
Saloniki.</p>

<p>Very early in the campaign the Bulgars seized Uskub, thus interposing a
wedge between the small Anglo-French force at Saloniki and the Serbs
about Nish to the north of Uskub. Meantime a desperate concentration was
taking place at Saloniki, and an Anglo-French force, commanded by
Sarrail, was being pushed up the Saloniki railroad toward Uskub to open
a road to the Serbs to join their allies. The operation suggested that
successfully conducted in Flanders in the opening months of the war,
which enabled the Belgian army to escape from Antwerp and join their
allies in Flanders.</p>

<p>But this operation failed. The French came north to the outskirts of
Veles, twenty miles from Uskub, just too late to save the Serbians, who
now fled west to Monastir and south to Montenegro and Albania. As a
fighting force the Serbs were eliminated, the wrecks of their armies
barely escaping to the Adriatic and Ægean coasts at Durazzo and
Saloniki. Bulgarian troops forced the Katchanik gorges and took
Prisrend, and German and Austrian forces entered the ill-omened Plain of
Kossovo and overran the ancient Sanjak of Novibazar.</p>

<p>Before the storm that was now moving south, the French and British
retreated upon Saloniki, and presently began to construct about this
Greek city lines and defenses recalling those Wellington built at Torres
Vedras before Lisbon to restrain the flood of Napoleonic invasion in the
Iberian peninsula. The conquest of the Balkan peninsula, save for
Greece, was now as complete as Napoleon's own success in Spain had been
more than a century before.</p>

<p>In due course of time an Austrian army repeated the operations of the
Germans, this time succeeding in reducing the strongholds of Montenegro,
which had defied the Turk through long centuries. Mount Lovetcen, the
peak which looks down upon Cattaro and commands the inner bay, was at
last taken, Scutari followed, northern Albania was overrun, Nicholas
followed Peter into exile. All Macedonia was taken and the Allies forced
out of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page102" name="page102"></a>(p. 102)</span> Serbia, which had become an entirely conquered country.
To complete the conquest of the Near East there was needed nothing but a
successful siege of Saloniki, but this required preparation and the
rebuilding of destroyed railroads, and so the Allies found respite in
this Ægean port for a brief time.</p>

<p>Such was Germany's third campaign. Her victory enabled her to send
munitions to Constantinople, and insured the failure of the allied
attack at the Dardanelles. Only a few weeks later the allied armies
evacuated the Gallipoli Peninsula; thus testifying to the decisive
character of the German operation. Still later Turkish reenforcements,
doubtless drawing upon German sources for munitions, defeated another
British expedition almost under the walls of Bagdad and drove it in
retreat down the Tigris, ultimately surrounding it at Kut-el-Amara, a
hundred miles to the south.</p>

<p>Again, there came immediately forecasts of another Turkish thrust at
Suez, under German direction, a first attack having failed in the
previous winter. Whether Germany actually obtained any considerable
stock of provisions or foodstuffs may be doubted by her succor, but it
is clear that her campaign had enabled her to make use of many thousands
of Turkish troops, who were waiting only for arms, it had given her
control of the Bulgarian army, a small but efficient force, and it had
provided an eventual means of attacking the British Empire by land, once
the advance upon Egypt could be organized.</p>

<p>This last circumstance is worth noting, for the time had now arrived
when the Germans perceived that Great Britain had so far escaped injury,
was the single one of the larger powers who had drawn profit without
terrible loss from the war and was becoming the determining force in the
allied camp, because its resources were still unexhausted and its armies
only just coming into the field, while German numbers were approaching a
positive decline. If Germany could reach Suez, conquer Egypt, using
Turkish armies and German genius and munitions, she would deal a heavy
blow to the British Empire, and she might compel the British to listen
to proposals for peace, which were now contemptuously thrust aside by
London.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page103" name="page103"></a>(p. 103)</span> In sum, the Serbian campaign saved Turkey, disposed of Serbia,
enlisted Bulgaria, opened the road to the Near East and to subsequent
attacks upon Egypt and perhaps upon India, but it did not bring peace,
and it did not inflict any immediate injury upon any one of Germany's
larger foes, only Serbia and Montenegro actually suffered serious loss,
and the destruction of their armies was but a detail in a world war.</p>


<h4>ITALY</h4>

<p>For the purposes of a summary it is unnecessary to review in detail the
Italian operations. They have no distinctive challenge to the reader.
Italian statesmanship imposed upon the Italian high command a task which
made immediate victory impossible, and assigned to Italy the useful but
inglorious rôle of occupying some 400,000 Austrian troops, and thus
contributing to the strain imposed upon the Central Powers and to the
hastening of the moment when exhaustion might be expected to set in.</p>

<p>Had Italy decided to enter the war at the moment when Russia was
destroying Austrian armies in Galicia in September and October of 1914
she would almost unquestionably have supplied the necessary numbers to
bring a speedy and decisive defeat for the Central Powers. Again, had
she selected the moment when Russian armies were at the crests of the
Carpathians, and Przemysl had just fallen, she would have probably made
the German offense against Russia impossible, brought Rumania in with
her, and produced the collapse of Austria. Bulgaria would not have
enlisted with the Central Powers, Greece would almost certainly have
attacked Turkey, and the Balkan campaign would not have taken place.</p>

<p>But German diplomacy averted the second peril, and Italian alignment
with Austria and with Germany in the Triple Alliance made an attack at
the opening of the war unthinkable. When Italy did come in, the German
victory in Galicia had been won, Russia was in retreat, the allied
defeat before the Dardanelles forts and the Russian disasters had
produced a profound effect <span class="pagenum"><a id="page104" name="page104"></a>(p. 104)</span> in Balkan capitals, and Austria was
able to find the troops to meet and check the Italian advance almost at
the frontier. Since that time the Italian operations have been merely
trench conflicts, and Italy has nowhere penetrated a score of miles into
Austrian territory, nor has she taken Trieste, Trent, or even Gorizia.</p>

<p>If one desires a parallel for the Italian operations it is to be found
in the later phases of the Peninsula War against Napoleon. This field
was never of decisive importance, but it did require the attention of
several of Napoleon's best marshals, and drew off thousands of French
soldiers needed by the great emperor in the campaigns in eastern
Germany, where his fortunes were finally decided. What Wellington did,
the Italians under Cadorna have been imitating in their own peninsula,
and their service to their allies has thus been very considerable.</p>

<p>Nor is it necessary for the purposes of so rapid a review of the main
phases of the war to dwell upon the allied failure in the west between
the end of the battles of Flanders in November, 1914, and February,
1916. At the beginning of 1915 what were allied hopes and purposes in
the west? Unquestionably French and British public believed that with
the coming year the Grand Alliance would be able to crush Germany.
Unquestionably French and British high commands planned to open the
summer with a drive that would clear France and Belgium. As for the
Germans, having laid their plans to go to Russia, they asked nothing of
their western armies save that the lines should be held.</p>

<p>The French began their spring drive in Artois and in Champagne. The
Artois fighting of May and June was exceedingly severe, incidental gains
were made, but the British were suddenly disclosed lacking in all proper
ammunition, lacking in numbers to support the French offensive, and
barely able to hold their own lines about Ypres, after desperate
fighting, made memorable by the first use by the Germans of gas as a
weapon of offense.</p>

<p>From June until September the western armies stood still, while Britain
organized her munition manufactures and continued to send her new troops
to the Continent. Kitchener's "million" was not realized until the late
fall, instead of the early spring. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page105" name="page105"></a>(p. 105)</span> But when, in the latter
days of September, the British attacked about La Bassée, and the French
in Champagne, the muddling of British officers cost the Allies a
considerable triumph in Artois, and the French victory in Champagne was
purely local. Some 30,000 prisoners, 200 cannon, this was the fruit of
an offensive which cost the British 60,000 casualties, and the French
hardly less than twice as many.</p>

<p>German defense, therefore, fulfilled its mission in the west, German
armies were able to drive deep into Russia without having to detach
reenforcements to the west. Such offensives as the Allies ventured were
either complete failures or merely local successes, without major value.
Belgium and northern France were not liberated, and there was, as yet,
not even a promise of the crushing of Germany.</p>


<h4>ALLIED POLICY</h4>

<p>In the brief space that remains I desire to discuss the policy of the
nations which are fighting the Teutonic Alliance. The German purpose at
the outset of the war has been discussed. Franco-Russian preparation had
been made long before the war, and the general plan of the high commands
of the two allies worked out without any material interruption. The same
is true of the cooperation of the British army. This simply followed out
the plans agreed upon years before.</p>

<p>It is not true, as has been frequently asserted, that France or her
allies were surprised by the German invasion of Belgium, this had long
been foreseen. It is not true, as was believed widely at the time, that
Joffre invited disaster by sending the mass of his troops into
Alsace-Lorraine, yielding to political and patriotic sentiment. He did
nothing of the sort. Such troops as were sent into these provinces
fulfilled their mission and contributed to drawing German corps away
from the north. The bulk of the French armies and the British
Expeditionary Corps were in line along the Belgium frontier from Arlon
to Mons when the Germans began their great drive.</p>

<p>The French were surprised in two respects. They had not foreseen the
rapidity with which the German heavy artillery <span class="pagenum"><a id="page106" name="page106"></a>(p. 106)</span> would reduce
the forts in Belgium, the fall of Namur was the greatest catastrophe of
the first period of the campaign, and they had not dreamed that the
Germans would be able to mobilize so many troops in so short a period.
Joffre had planned to meet the Germans along the Meuse and the Sambre,
that is along the French frontier, but when the German advance began,
his troops on these fronts were outnumbered by at least two to one, not
because the mass of the French troops had been sent to Alsace-Lorraine,
but because the French had not foreseen the capacity of the Germans to
mobilize their reserves and had little more than their first-line troops
ready, while the Germans were making use of Landwehr and even Landsturm
formations in the first shock.</p>

<p>Once this fact was clearly established, Joffre resolutely drew his
forces back until he was able to put more reserves in the field and thus
approximately restore the balance between the two armies. But he was
still heavily outnumbered at the decisive moment, winning his great
battle with inferior forces. His enemy had reckoned on the traditional
eagerness of the French to attack, and had expected to obtain a decisive
victory, through superior numbers, in the first days of the war. The
impression which the press reports gave in the early days, that the
French were driven from defeat to defeat and almost succumbed to the
German attack is far from accurate. In point of fact, the French armies,
after suffering marked but relatively insignificant reverses at the
outset, reverses due to the blunders of the subordinate generals in
part, and to the greatly superior German numbers and artillery in the
main, were drawn back in obedience to a carefully conceived plan, were
denied the opportunity to fight, as they desired, until the exhaustion
of German strength, ammunition, and transport, and the increase in
French numbers gave the opportunity for a victory. The whole opening
campaign was fought on the French side with a very keen recollection of
the mistakes of 1870, and the result justified the strategy.</p>

<p>But with the end of the Battle of the Marne both the Allied and the
German plans collapsed. Neither side had foreseen clearly the
possibility of a battle in which the French might <span class="pagenum"><a id="page107" name="page107"></a>(p. 107)</span> win a
decisive victory, yet lack the numbers to enforce the decision
absolutely. But the Germans were able to meet the situation promptly
and, by preparing a position on the Aisne, to retain a considerable
portion of the ground they had occupied in their first rush. Thus in
failing to repeat their triumphs of the Franco-Prussian War and of the
Seven Weeks' War, they had escaped the disaster of Napoleon at Waterloo,
when he, too, had staked all on a single throw.</p>

<p>In the weeks and months that followed the German defeat at the Marne,
allied understanding of the actual nature of the war developed only
slowly. Until the coming of spring and the British failure to get men or
munitions, the French and the British public, and probably their
soldiers, believed that the Germans were shortly to be turned out of
France. But with the failure there was at last established the real
situation, the war had taken on the character of our own Civil War, it
had become a struggle in which the decision would follow the exhaustion
of one of the contending forces and the incidental victories of either
side could not contribute materially to the ending of the war.</p>

<p>In the Civil War the North was exceedingly slow in learning this lesson
and it was not until General Grant at last assumed the command of all
the Northern armies that an intelligent policy was adopted. This policy
has been summarized as the policy of attrition and it is now generally
recognized as the policy on which the enemies of the Central Powers rely
for ultimate success. Grant's own statement of this policy was as
follows: "To hammer continuously against the armed force of the enemy
and his resources, until by mere attrition, if in no other way, there
should be left to him nothing but submission." By this policy Grant won
his war.</p>

<p>Now the allied policy, which it is necessary to recognize, to understand
the war as it is viewed by one of the two contending forces, is this:
The Allies are satisfied that the German numbers have begun or are
beginning to fail. They fix at around 8,000,000 the total man power of
Germany at the outset, using all means of computation including their
own experience. They <span class="pagenum"><a id="page108" name="page108"></a>(p. 108)</span> figure that at the end of the first
eighteen months Germany had lost permanently not less than 3,500,000,
possibly 4,000,000. They know that it requires upwards of 3,000,000 men
to hold Germany's present lines and about 1,000,000 to perform other
necessary services.</p>

<p>Now no such wastage has to be faced by the Allies as a whole. France is
in the German situation, but Great Britain is still possessed of large
numbers of men and her losses are under 600,000, while her population
together with that of her colonies is above 60,000,000, whites alone
being considered, against Germany's 67,000,000. Russia's man power is
practically limited only by the ability to equip and munition. Italy
has, as yet, made little draft upon her resources. Austria, on the other
hand, has suffered more heavily, proportionately figured, than Germany.</p>

<p>Within a time that can be approximately fixed, the Allies believe that
Germany will have either to shorten her lines or underman them. If she
undermans them she will face the peril that overtook Lee about Richmond,
when, as he said, his lines were stretched so thin, they broke. If
Germany shortens her lines, this will be a confession of defeat and will
deprive her of the conquered territories. Meantime the entire strategy
of the Allies is summed up in Grant's grim words, and as Grant kept up
his hammering on all the fronts of the Confederacy so the Allies are
keeping up their pressure.</p>

<p>But attrition of men is only half; there is the question of food and of
money. Command of the sea insures the food supply of the Allies and
their financial resources greatly surpass those of Germany. Germany is
suffering&mdash;we have Harden's word for this, because of food shortage, she
is suffering from economic paralysis resulting from the blockade and she
is suffering from the lack of certain materials needed in war. She is
compelled to find money for her other and poorer allies. The enemies of
Germany do not expect that she will be starved out or that she will have
to surrender for lack of materials to make ammunition. But they do
believe that shortage of food, economic pressure, financial
difficulties, will go hand in hand with the failure of numbers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page109" name="page109"></a>(p. 109)</span> In a word the Allies are fighting a war with many weapons of
which the army is only one and the British navy another, perhaps the
most effective. They are not fighting to win a campaign and they are not
basing their expectation of victory on the incidents in any one field or
in any single campaign. The Germans, on the contrary, as we have seen,
have undertaken three tremendous campaigns, the first to win an absolute
victory on the battle field, a victory which would make the Germany of
William II the successor of the France of Napoleon I in Europe; the
second to dispose of one of the great foes and thereby win a limited but
considerable success; the third to win peace and an incidental
opportunity to expand toward the east, the only direction in which
expansion cannot be checked by sea power.</p>

<p>The Allies still expect to crush Germany; by crushing Germany they mean
bringing her back to her frontiers of 1914, detaching Alsace-Lorraine
from her and possibly Prussian territory east of the Vistula. They mean
to destroy her fleet, demand indemnities for Belgian and French
sufferers, they mean to abolish what they regard as the Prussian menace
to peace. They are fighting Germany as Europe fought Napoleon and with
the same determination. On the German side the struggle is also being
waged in the Napoleonic fashion, Germany is seeking to employ the
Napoleonic method and has so far achieved something of the early success
of the great emperor.</p>

<p>But the simplest fashion in which to describe the later phases of the
conflict is to say that a war of action has become a war of endurance,
that Germany has sought and missed a decision on the battle field and
her foes are now seeking the decision through economic forces quite as
much as military and through casualty lists rather than brilliant
campaigns.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>





<h2><span class="pagenum"><a id="page113" name="page113"></a>(p. 113)</span> THE WAR CORRESPONDENT<br>

<span class="smaller smcap">By ARTHUR RUHL</span></h2>


<p>When the American fleet was sent to Vera Cruz in the summer of 1914 and
it looked for a time as if an army might go into Mexico, Major General
Funston explained the conditions under which correspondents were to go
to the front. There was to be no repetition of the scandalous
free-for-all of the Spanish War, when news prospectors of all sorts and
descriptions swarmed over to Cuba in almost as haphazard fashion as Park
Row reporters are rushed uptown to cover a subway explosion or a
four-alarm fire.</p>

<p>The number of men was to be limited and their privileges strictly
defined. Only the press associations and some twenty or thirty
newspapers were to send correspondents, and they must put up substantial
bonds for each man&mdash;one for his good behavior, the other to serve as an
expense fund against which would be charged his keep as a civilian guest
of the army. These conditions fulfilled, the men were to accompany the
expedition with the privileges, practically, of officers or neutral
attachés.</p>

<p>They would join an officers' mess or have a mess of their own with
similar service; they might provide their own horses which would be
cared for with the other horses of the unit to which they were attached.
They were to stay where they were put, so far as nearness to the
fighting was concerned, according to the judgment of the commanding
officer, and all their dispatches must first pass a military censor.</p>

<p>These rules were read with some dismay by those not included in the
provisional list. To many who had hoped to see something of a war they
doubtless seemed severe, yet it is a fact that had they been put into
effect, the correspondents in Mexico would <span class="pagenum"><a id="page114" name="page114"></a>(p. 114)</span> have seen much
more, comparatively speaking, than any group of correspondents has seen
in Europe. They would actually have accompanied the army, sharing
throughout the expedition the day-to-day life of the fighting men, like
the old-fashioned "horseback correspondent"&mdash;and nobody in Europe has
done that.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the war, England permitted no correspondents at all
at the front, and while a group was chosen, it was well into 1915 before
they were even allowed to cross to France. Once they reached their
headquarters they saw a good deal. They lived at or near the front
instead of merely shooting up and back for a glimpse of it. They met
many officers more or less intimately, saw the life behind and in the
trenches; occasionally they were taken to observation stations from
which they saw the effect of artillery fire, and even, perhaps, in the
distance, charging infantry. Yet the number who had even these
privileges was so limited that it included but one American.</p>

<p>Mr. Frederick Palmer was thus chosen to act as a sort of correspondent
at large for the American press. Mr. Ashmead Bartlett, an English
journalist, acted in a similar capacity for the English press and,
indeed, for the rest of the world, at the Dardanelles. He saw a great
deal, as much, perhaps, as any reporter has seen of any campaign, but he
was almost alone in his glory, and so far as the distribution of such
privileges is concerned, the English have been more cautious than any of
the belligerents.</p>

<p>The French military authorities were more open minded, yet, while a few
favored sons or the head of some press association whose position in
Paris was almost as secure as that of an accredited diplomat, were
quietly taken up to the trenches from the first, several months had
elapsed before a group of correspondents went to the front. The
desirability of publicity was better understood later, many neutral
correspondents visited the trenches, and a few specially favored
individuals spent some time at or near the front, but, even here,
permission was obtained as a result of individual effort rather than as
a part of a general scheme for handling, more or less impersonally, all
applicants in good standing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page115" name="page115"></a>(p. 115)</span> In Germany, correspondents were rather freely taken to the
various fronts from the first. One reason for this, was, perhaps, that
the Germans, with their thorough organization of everything, including
censorship and secret service, may have known better just how far they
could go. They were not afraid of what might get through the wall,
because the wall was tight, and they knew just what could get out and
what couldn't. At any rate, many reporters, both native born and
foreign, were getting glimpses of the various fronts while the English
group were still eating their heads off in London. Once there, however,
they saw less, as a rule, than the English correspondents finally did,
for their trips were generally mere visits&mdash;a sort of Cook's tour in war
time.</p>

<p>A quotation from an article of mine in "Collier's" written after a trip
through Belgium and down to the first-line German trenches at Givenchy
will suggest the nature of these excursions:</p>

<p>"You go out a sort of zoo&mdash;our party included four or five Americans, a
Greek, an Italian (Italy had not yet gone into the war), a diminutive
Spaniard and a tall, preoccupied Swede&mdash;under the direction of some
hapless officer of the General Staff. For a week, perhaps, you go
hurtling through a closely articulated program, almost as helpless as a
package in a pneumatic tube&mdash;night expresses, racing military motors,
snapshots at this and that, down a bewildering vista of long gray capes,
heel clickings, stiff bows from the waist, and punctilious military
salutes. You are under fire one minute, the next shooting through some
captured palace or barracks or museum of antiques. At noon the guard is
turned out in honor, at four you are watching distant shell fire from
the Belgian dunes; at eleven crawling under a down quilt in some French
hotel where the prices of food and wines are fixed by the local
commandant. Everything is done for you&mdash;more, of course, than one would
wish&mdash;the gifted young captain conductor speaks English one minute,
French or Italian the next, gets you up in the morning, to bed at night,
past countless sentries and thick-headed guards demanding an <i>Ausweis</i>,
contrives never to cease looking as if he had stepped from the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page116" name="page116"></a>(p. 116)</span>
bandbox, and presently pops you into your hotel in Berlin with the
curious feeling of never having been away at all."</p>

<p>There were a great many trips of this sort under the auspices of the
German General Staff, and every neutral correspondent who came to Berlin
with letters establishing his position as a serious workman in good
standing in his own country, could hope, after a reasonable interval for
getting acquainted, to obtain permission to go on one of them. It was
not an ideal way of working, to be sure, yet the "front" was a big and
rather accidental place, and one could scarcely touch it anywhere
without bringing back something to help complete the civilian's puzzle
picture of war.</p>

<p>One man would get a chance to spend a night in the trenches, with the
sky criss-crossed with searchlight shafts and illuminating bombs; an
automobile party might be caught on some East Prussian road with the
woods on either side crackling with rifle fire as the skirmishers beat
through the timber after the scattered enemy as after so many squirrels.
Our moment came one afternoon in the German trenches at Givenchy, when,
with the English trenches only a stone's throw away, both sides began to
amuse themselves by shooting dynamite bombs.</p>

<p>Groups of native-born correspondents were likely to see rather more than
outsiders, and the more authoritative home writers were attached not
infrequently to an army corps or staff headquarters for weeks at a time.
The Berlin and Vienna bookshops are filled with books and pamphlets
written by such men, though, of course, little of their correspondence
has ever reached America. A man like Ludwig Ganghofer, for instance,
became so much of an institution that papers even joked about him, and I
remember a cartoon&mdash;in "Jugend," I think&mdash;picturing him puffing up a
hill where a staff was waiting and the commanding officer saying
"Ganghofer's here. The attack may now begin!"</p>

<p>In Germany, however, as in France, at least during the first year of the
war, each correspondent, particularly a foreigner, was merely a
privateer, making his own fight for a chance to work, and pulling what
wires he could. After his brief excursion he returned to Berlin, a mere
tourist, so to speak, and had to begin <span class="pagenum"><a id="page117" name="page117"></a>(p. 117)</span> the old tiresome
round&mdash;his own embassy&mdash;the German Foreign Office&mdash;the War Office&mdash;all
over again. There was no organization in which he could enroll, so to
speak, he had no permanent standing. This drawback&mdash;from the
correspondent's point of view&mdash;was met in Austria-Hungary by the Presse
Quartier, an integral part of the army like any other branch of the
service, whose function it was to handle the whole complicated business
of war correspondence.</p>

<p>The Austro-Hungarians, prepared from the first for a large number of
civilian observers, including news and special writers, photographers,
illustrators and painters, and, to handle them satisfactorily, organized
this Presse Quartier, once admitted to which&mdash;the fakers and
fly-by-nights were supposed to be weeded out by preliminary red
tape&mdash;they were assumed to be serious workmen and treated as the army's
guests.</p>

<p>The Presse Quartier&mdash;the Germans later organized one on somewhat
different lines&mdash;was in two sections; an executive section with a
commandant responsible for the arrangement of trips to the various
fronts and the general business of censorship and publicity; and a
second, an entertainment section, so to speak, also with its commandant,
whose business it was to board, lodge, and otherwise look after
correspondents when they were not on trips to the front. At the time I
visited the Presse Quartier the executive section was in the city of
Teschen, across the border of Silesia; the correspondents lived in the
village of Nagybicse in Hungary, two or three hours' railroad journey
away. In this village&mdash;the most novel part of the scheme&mdash;some thirty or
forty correspondents were living, writing their past adventures, setting
forth on new ones, or merely inviting their souls for the moment under a
régime which combined the functions of tourists' bureau, rest cure, and
a sort of military club.</p>

<p>For the time being they were part of the army&mdash;fed, lodged, and
transported at the army's expense, and unable to leave without formal
military permission. They were supposed to "enlist for the whole war,"
so to speak, and most of the Austro-Hungarian and German correspondents
had so remained&mdash;some had <span class="pagenum"><a id="page118" name="page118"></a>(p. 118)</span> even written books there&mdash;but a good
deal of freedom was allowed observers from neutral countries and
permission given to go when they felt they had seen enough.</p>

<p>Isolated thus in the country&mdash;the only mail the military field post, the
only telegrams those that passed the military censor&mdash;correspondents
were as "safe" as in Siberia. They, on the other hand, had the
advantages of an established position, of living inexpensively in
pleasant surroundings where their relations with the censor and the army
were less those of policemen and of suspicious characters than of host
and guest. To be welcomed here, after the usual fretful dangling and
wire-pulling in war office anterooms and city hotels was reassuring
enough.</p>

<p>Correspondents were quartered in private houses, and as there was one
man to a family, generally, he was put in the villager's room of honor,
with a tall porcelain stove in the corner, a feather bed under him and
another on top. Each man had a soldier servant who looked after his
boots and luggage, kept him supplied with cigars and cigarettes from the
Quartier commissariat&mdash;for a paternal government included even
tobacco!&mdash;and whack his heels together whenever spoken to and flung back
an obedient "Ja wohl!" We breakfasted separately, whenever we felt like
it, lunched and dined&mdash;officers and correspondents&mdash;together. There were
soldier waiters, and on every table big carafes of Hungarian white wine,
drunk generally instead of water. For beer one paid extra.</p>

<p>The commandant and his staff, including a doctor, and the officer-guides
not on excursions at the moment, sat at the head of the long U-shaped
table. Anyone who came in or went out after the commandant was supposed
to advance a bit into this "U," catch his eye, bow and receive his
returning nod. The silver click of spurs, of course, accompanied this
salute when an officer left the room, and Austro-Hungarian and German
correspondents generally snapped their heels together in semi-military
fashion. All our goings and comings, indeed, were accompanied by a good
deal of manner. People who had seen each other at breakfast shook hands
formally half an hour later in the village square, and one bowed and was
bowed <span class="pagenum"><a id="page119" name="page119"></a>(p. 119)</span> to and heard the sing-song "habe die Ehre!" a dozen
times a day.</p>

<p>With amenities of this nature the Quartier guests passed their time
while waiting their turn to go to the front. There were always, while I
was there, one or more parties in the field, either on the Italian or
the Russian front, or both, while a few writers and artists were well
enough known to be permitted to go out alone. The Hungarian, Mr. Molnar,
for instance, whose play, "The Devil," was seen in America a few years
ago, was writing at that time a series of letters under the general
title, "Wanderings on the East Front," and apparently, within obvious
military limitations, he did wander. One day, another man came into
lunch with the news that he was off on the best trip he'd had yet&mdash;he
was going back to Vienna for his skis, to go down into the Tyrol and
work along glaciers to the battery positions. Another man, a Budapest
painter, started off for an indefinite stay with an army corps in
Bessarabia. He was to be, indeed, part of the army for the time being,
and all his work belonged to the army first.</p>

<p>Foreigners not intending to remain in Austria-Hungary could not expect
such privileges, naturally; but if they were admitted to the Quartier at
all they were sent on the ordinary group excursions like the home
correspondents themselves. Indeed, the wonder was&mdash;in view of the
comparative ease with which neutral correspondents drifted about Europe;
the naiveté to put it mildly, with which the wildest romances had been
printed in American newspapers&mdash;that we were permitted to see as much as
we did.</p>

<p>When a group started for the front it left Nagybicse in its own car,
which, except when the itinerary included some large city&mdash;Lemberg, for
instance&mdash;served as a little hotel until they came back again. The car
was a clean, second-class coach, of the usual European compartment kind,
two men to a compartment, and at night they bunked on the long
transverse seat comfortably enough. We took one long trip of a thousand
miles or so in this way, taking our own motor, on a separate flat car,
and even an orderly servant for each man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page120" name="page120"></a>(p. 120)</span> Each of these groups was, of course, accompanied by an officer
guide&mdash;several were detailed at the Quartier for this special
duty&mdash;whose complex and nerve-racking task it was to answer all
questions, make all arrangements, report to each local commandant, pass
sentries, and comfortably waft his flock of civilians through the maze
of barriers which cover every foot, so to speak, of this region near the
front.</p>

<p>The things correspondents were permitted to see differed from those seen
on the other fronts less in kind than in quantity. More trips were made,
but there is and can be little place for a civilian on a "front," any
spot in which, over a strip several miles wide, from the heavy artillery
positions of one side to the heavy artillery of the other, may be in
absolute quiet one minute and the next the center of fire.</p>

<p>There is no time to bother with civilians during an offensive, and, if a
retreat is likely, no commander wishes to have country described which
may presently be in the hands of the enemy. Hidden batteries in action,
reserves moving up, wounded coming back, flyers, trenches quiet for the
moment&mdash;this is about as close to actual fighting as the outsider, under
ordinary circumstances, can expect to get on any front.</p>

<p>The difference in Austria-Hungary was that correspondents saw these
things, and the battle fields and captured cities, not as mere
outsiders, picked up from a hotel and presently to be dropped there
again, but as, in a sense, a part of the army itself. They had their
commandant to report to, their "camp" and "uniform"&mdash;the gold-and-black
Presse Quartier arm band&mdash;and they returned to headquarters with the
reasonable certainty that in another ten days or so they would start out
again.</p>

<p>Another advantage of the Quartier was the avoidance of the not uncommon
friction between the civilians of the Foreign Office and the soldiers of
the War Office. The Foreign Office runs things, so to speak, in times of
peace and it is to the Foreign Office that the diplomatic
representatives of foreign powers apply for favors for their own
fellow-citizens. But in war time the army runs things, and the Foreign
Office official who has charge of correspondents is continually
promising things or <span class="pagenum"><a id="page121" name="page121"></a>(p. 121)</span> wishing to do things he is not sure of
being able to carry out. The result is often a rather unpleasant sort of
competitive wire-pulling between correspondents, some trying the Foreign
Office, some the War Office, some attacking both at the same time&mdash;one
would even hear it said now and then that the surest way to get anything
from the soldiers was to complain to them that the Foreign Office
civilians wouldn't do anything for you!</p>

<p>In Austria-Hungary the Presse Quartier acted as a bridge between the
two. It was the definite court to which all applicants were referred and
a good deal of aimless waiting about and wire-pulling eliminated at
once. And having cleared away the preliminary red-tape, the
correspondent had, in the Quartier commandant, an agent more likely to
push his interests than the civilian officials back in the capital and
more likely to be listened to by those at the front.</p>

<p>The war correspondent had been "killed off" so many times in newspapers
and magazines of late years that one might expect him to be as dead as
the dodo, and of course the old-fashioned "horseback" correspondent&mdash;a
sort of unofficial envoy extraordinary from the reading public, who
carried his own elaborate outfit and rode more or less where he
pleased&mdash;is extinct. A horse would have been about as useful on most of
the European fronts, under the conditions prescribed, as a rowboat. What
the correspondent needed, in the few hours he was permitted to see
anything, was a fast motor car, and quite as much as the car itself the
pass, without which it would have been stopped at the first crossroads.</p>

<p>Wandering round the active front where any point in a strip of several
miles wide, however apparently peaceful, is under observation and likely
to be at any moment under fire, is not practicable even were it
permitted. Modern artillery, long range rifles, aeroplanes and field
telephones have put an end to such strolling; while the elaborate system
of communication in such highly civilized neighborhoods as those in
which the present war is being fought, and the care with which every
scrap of information about the enemy is pieced together and coordinated,
makes <span class="pagenum"><a id="page122" name="page122"></a>(p. 122)</span> it imperative that every possible source of such
information shall be controlled.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the Great War had no sooner started than the old guard
bobbed up serenely, and with them new ones&mdash;men and women writers,
adventurous novelists, privateers of all sorts. They have kept on
working and seeing more or less, and have performed necessary and
valuable service. They have described the life behind the front, the
life in towns, camps, prisons, hospitals and given the news&mdash;the rough
general outlines&mdash;of the swiftly changing drama. Very few have seen any
fighting, properly speaking, and although bits of their work here and
there deserve to become part of the permanent history of the war, they
themselves would be the last to suggest that they have told the real
story.</p>

<p>The real story is of two kinds. There is the narrative of the events,
the orderly, understanding arrangement and coordination of the showers
of facts and rumors that blow in from a hundred sources to the great
news centers far from the front. And there is the story of personal
experience, the sensations of the individual as he looks into the face
of war. The first tells what happened, the other how it felt. For the
one, the correspondent is too near, for the other too far away.</p>

<p>The division of the enormous battle fronts into innumerable little
news-tight compartments, so to speak, understood in their entirety only
by the commanders in chief at the centers of the telegraph and telephone
network far behind the front, makes it impossible for a correspondent to
see very far beyond his own nose. Even were he permitted to understand
the general plan of his own army he could scarcely know, while still at
the front, the general plan of the enemy. A well-informed observer
working comfortably at his desk in one of the capitals, with the news of
the world at his disposal, with experts on every subject within easy
calling distance, and with every sort of map and reference book, is much
better able to write a story of the war&mdash;such a story as this, for
instance&mdash;than any correspondent actually at the front, however
fortunately situated. There have been many such "correspondents at home"
and reporters returning from first-hand <span class="pagenum"><a id="page123" name="page123"></a>(p. 123)</span> glimpses of this and
that, have often for the first time understood the significance of such
details when they were seen through the broad perspective and leisurely
analysis of such long-distance observers.</p>

<p>The nourishing flavor of such a little book as Fritz Kreisler's "Four
Weeks in the Trenches"&mdash;scarcely more than a magazine article, with no
sensational adventures and no attempt at rhetorical effect, and of
several little collections of published letters&mdash;reveals at once the
correspondent's other disability. People feel that this man really was
<i>there</i>&mdash;this is what one real man with a gun in his hand did feel, and
not what some civilian, sitting safely out of range, imagines crowds of
men might have felt. Its very incompleteness, things left out because of
sensibilities so stunned that events made no mark as they whirled by, is
often more impressive than the conventional war correspondent's
cocksureness and windy eloquence. There are scores of men like this
gifted violinist&mdash;playwriters, painters, journalists, men trained to see
things in various ways&mdash;drawn in by universal service and now buried in
the mass, but destined some day to emerge to normal life.</p>

<p>From them the story of the individual, of the fighting itself, must come
long after the war is over. It will come piecemeal, from diaries now
stuck away in the soldiers' pockets, from memories that will only begin
to act when peace has given weary brains a chance to work again, from
men now tired and dirty and horror-stunned and scarcely able to remember
their own names.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>




<h2><span class="pagenum"><a id="page125" name="page125"></a>(p. 125)</span> PART I&mdash;INDIRECT CAUSES OF THE WAR</h2>

<p class="title">POLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC HISTORY OF EUROPE FROM 1866 TO 1914 WITH A
CHAPTER ON THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF JAPAN</p>


<p>In order to understand properly the underlying causes which were
responsible for the outbreak of the Great European War of 1914, it is
necessary to be acquainted with the recent historical development of the
various nations involved. In considering the various phases of this
development it becomes evident that in modern times the history of any
<i>one</i> country exerts a powerful influence upon the history of all the
other countries. The vast development of means of communication between
the various countries of the earth&mdash;railways, steamships, telegraphs,
telephones&mdash;resulted in an equally vast increase of their commercial and
social intercourse until one might almost claim that there is not a
single event of any importance whatsoever happening in <i>one</i> country
which does not make its influence felt throughout the entire world. It
is not always easy or even possible to determine the exact degree to
which the various nations of the world are affected by this mutual
interdependency, and frequently many years elapse before it becomes
evident at all that what one nation has done or neglected to do has an
important relation to the fate of another nation, even though the two
nations may have few points of contact and be separated by great
distances.</p>

<p>To describe historical events as they happen day by day or even year by
year throughout the modern world is an almost hopeless task, because a
description of this nature would result in a confusion which would be
even worse than an entire lack of knowledge concerning these matters. We
will, therefore, consider separately the historical development of each
nation and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page126" name="page126"></a>(p. 126)</span> thereby try to arrive finally at a clear
understanding of the historical causes of the Great War of 1914.</p>

<p>Some of these causes, of course, may be claimed to go back to the
beginnings of the history of the various nations; but a majority of them
had their origin in comparatively recent times. It is also true that the
Napoleonic Wars resulted in certain international alignments some of
which, at least in part, held over until comparatively recently. But it
was only approximately at the beginning of the second half of the
nineteenth century that international relations assumed the important
position and the fateful influence which they hold now. The short war of
1866 between Prussia and Austria, fought primarily to determine the
supremacy in German affairs, may conveniently be considered for our
purposes a starting point of modern international history because it
resulted in changes so important that their final results had a powerful
influence over the fate of the entire civilized world. Inasmuch as this
war affected more directly Germany and Austria, we will first consider
these two countries.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>




<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="title">GERMANY</p>


<p>In 1866 there was strictly speaking no Germany. That part of the world
which during the past forty-five years has been known as Germany
consisted of a large number of small states and principalities, speaking
the same language and having in a general way the same customs and
ideals. All attempts to find some basis for their political unification,
however, miscarried. Whenever Prussia, which beyond doubt was the
biggest and most powerful of all the German-speaking states, attempted
to take the lead it was opposed by powerful Austria as well as by a
varying number of smaller states. The latter, much as they desired in
certain ways to bring about a united Germany in order to be better
protected against their much more powerful neighbors, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page127" name="page127"></a>(p. 127)</span> Russia
and France, feared these hardly more than a Germany under the control of
Prussia. It gradually became clear that unification of Germany would
never be realized as long as Austria and Prussia were contending for
leadership. How utterly impossible it was for these two countries to
achieve any lasting success as long as they made a common cause of
anything had been proven only two years earlier, when both went to war
with Denmark about the succession to the throne of the duchies of
Schleswig-Holstein. For no sooner had they succeeded through their
combined efforts in defeating Denmark and thereby forced the northern
kingdom to relinquish its claims on Schleswig-Holstein than they found
it next to impossible to settle among themselves the division of the
newly acquired territory.</p>

<p>It was about at this time that the greatest statesman of modern Germany,
Bismarck, began to become all powerful. It was he who recognized more
clearly than anyone else the need of eliminating Austria from German
affairs, and then finding some cause which would appeal strongly and
equally to all the other German states. The difficulties connected with
the division of Schleswig-Holstein offered to him an opportune cause for
a quarrel with Austria, and when he felt in 1866 that the Prussian army
had been sufficiently re-formed and built up to overpower not only
Austria, but any of the other German states which might possibly join
with her, he went to war. Prussia had succeeded in forming an alliance
with the newly united Italy on the basis of the latter's desire to
regain the north Italian territory which was then in the possession of
Austria. On the other hand the latter had drawn to its side the kingdoms
of Hanover and Saxony, as well as all the south German states. The war
was one of the shortest in the history of mankind, considering the size
of the countries involved and the odds at stake. In less than two
months, after only one important battle&mdash;at Sadowa&mdash;had been fought on
July 3, and lost by the Austrians, peace was concluded at Prague. As a
result of the arrangements made then, Austria was eliminated from German
affairs and withdrew all its claims for Schleswig-Holstein, and Prussia
was free to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page128" name="page128"></a>(p. 128)</span> form a confederation of the north German states
with itself as a leader, while the south German states were permitted to
form a federation of their own. Austria furthermore lost Venetia to
Italy. Of the Austrian allies, the south German states were let off easy
with a money indemnity, but Hanover, Nassau, and Hesse-Cassel lost their
independence and became part and parcel of the Prussian kingdom.</p>

<p>This addition to its territory made Prussia even more predominant in
Germany than it had been in the past and Bismarck immediately proceeded
to take the first step in the unification of Germany. This took the form
of the North German Confederation and so well did he build at that time
that the new government which he conceived then has ever since remained
the government of united Germany. In its way it was unique. It was a
mixture of monarchism and federation. Each of the federated states
retained a large amount of control over its internal affairs, but
yielded to Prussia control of its armies, foreign relations, railways,
and posts and telegraphs. The King of Prussia became the president of
this federation and as such its chief executive. The legislative powers
were intrusted to two bodies, the Bundesrat and the Reichstag, the
former representing the various states, the latter their people. The
members of the Bundesrat were appointed by the rulers of the states
which they represented, whereas the members of the Reichstag were
elected by universal manhood suffrage.</p>

<p>This rise of Prussia's power and influence disturbed and displeased,
among all the European states, none more than France. It was only a few
years before Napoleon III saw himself forced, partly through internal
difficulties and partly through his failures in Mexico and Italy, to
challenge William I of Prussia. In this combat the predominancy in
German affairs was no longer at stake, as it had been between Prussia
and Austria; but so powerful had Prussia become that France felt it
necessary to defend the leadership in Central European affairs which it
then claimed. The revolution which had broken out in 1868 in Spain and
resulted in the expulsion of Queen Isabella became the indirect cause of
the Franco-Prussian War. After various <span class="pagenum"><a id="page129" name="page129"></a>(p. 129)</span> unsuccessful attempts
on the part of Spanish statesmen to find a king for their country among
the European princes they offered the crown of Spain to Prince Leopold
of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, a relative of the King of Prussia.
Naturally the prospect of having a German prince rule its western
neighbor greatly excited France and led immediately to a strong protest
on its part. But not satisfied with this Napoleon demanded from King
William a promise that he should at no time permit his cousin to accept
the Spanish throne. These demands of the French were promptly refused by
the King of Prussia, and Bismarck and Von Moltke saw to it that the
message as delivered was brusque and calculated to excite France to
anger. Indeed, opinion was so deeply stirred that Napoleon felt
compelled to ask for a declaration of war. On July 19, 1870, this step
was taken.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly Napoleon was influenced in his decision by his expectation
that the south German states would either side openly with him or else
at least refuse to side with Prussia, basing this hope on their fear
that if Prussia should become all powerful in Germany their own
independence would be threatened. His expectations, however, were not
realized. As much through the wonderful statesmanship of Bismarck, who
knew when to give as well as when to take, as through the awakening of
an immensely strong national feeling throughout the length and breadth
of Germany, the south Bavarian states, within a few days after France
had declared war, sided openly with Prussia. This combination proved too
strong for France, for it was superior not only in numbers and
equipment, but especially in leadership. The unified German armies won
battle after battle in quick succession and by September 2, Napoleon
found himself with a large army hopelessly surrounded in Sedan and was
forced to surrender. He was sent to Germany as a prisoner of war and his
downfall resulted in the end of the Second Napoleonic Empire and the
declaration of the Third French Republic.</p>

<p>The German armies immediately proceeded to the siege of Paris and on
January 8, 1871, the French capital had to capitulate. A few months
later, in May, France and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page130" name="page130"></a>(p. 130)</span> Germany made peace, the former
paying an indemnity of $1,000,000,000 and ceding Alsace and a part of
Lorraine. In the meantime the unification of Germany had progressed
rapidly. Even before Paris had fallen, the German princes, headed by the
King of Bavaria, had offered to King William the presidency over a new
federation containing both the north and the south German states. This
federation was to be known as the German Empire and its president as the
German Emperor. On January 18, 1871, in the Hall of Mirrors at
Versailles King William accepted this offer, and was proclaimed German
Emperor.</p>

<p>It was quite natural that in the beginning the path of the newly created
German Empire should not be strewn exclusively with roses. At the time
of its formation, it is true, it had nothing to fear from other nations.
France which, in a way, may be considered at that time as its only
external enemy, had been beaten, and beaten in such a way that it was
clear that years would have to elapse before the new republic would be
in a position to undertake anything against Germany. Indeed, a great
many thoughtful people throughout the entire civilized world were hoping
that this period of recuperation through which France was bound to pass
would result in a gradual understanding between Germany and France. The
gulf which separated them immediately after the Franco-Prussian War, to
be sure, was wide; for the attitude of the two peoples in regard to the
taking over of Alsace-Lorraine was widely different. The French felt
that Germany had abused its power at the moment of its victory to tear
an integral part off the body politic of the republic. They vowed that
although the necessity of the moment had forced them to submit they
would never forget the "lost provinces," and this spirit, this demand
for restitution, was fostered and nourished throughout the years to
come. From time to time it seemed as if the great masses of people in
the two countries would finally reach an understanding. But whenever the
cry for restitution seemed to have been stilled, politicians of one kind
or another succeeded in making it sound again. Germany on the other hand
claimed that Alsace-Lorraine had originally been a German <span class="pagenum"><a id="page131" name="page131"></a>(p. 131)</span>
province, had been taken from Germany by force, and that the French had
neither a legal nor moral claim to the territory.</p>

<p>Internally the new chancellor of the German Empire had a great many
battles to fight in order to achieve the financial, social, and military
reforms which he deemed necessary for the safety and upbuilding of the
empire. It is not necessary for our purposes to go into these struggles
in detail. It suffices to note in passing that they resulted in
increases and in vast improvements of the German army, and laid the
foundation for the marvelous industrial and commercial expansion of the
German Empire.</p>

<p>The leading men of the German Empire fully appreciated the need of their
country of a long period of peace in order to work out the many problems
which the unification had brought about. In every possible way the
diplomats, politicians, and rulers of the various German states did
their best to make it clear to the other nations that they had no desire
for further conquests and were, to say the least, as anxious as their
neighbors to maintain peace. In 1872 the three emperors of Russia,
Austria, and Germany met together with their ministers at Berlin, and
although no treaty was concluded at that time, the conferences which
took place then and throughout the following years had a powerful
influence on the continuation of European peace. About the same time
Italy also attempted to show its good will toward Germany by sending the
crown prince of the new kingdom on a visit to the German Emperor, and it
seemed at that time as if the fate of all of Europe and, indeed, of the
entire civilized world, was in the hands of the central European
states&mdash;Germany, Austria, Russia, and Italy. Both France and England
seemed to be isolated.</p>

<p>However, it was not long before clouds appeared on the firmament, and
they came, as they had come before, and as they were to come again, from
the East.</p>

<p>The first disturbance of the cordial relations, that apparently had been
established among Germany, Austria, and Russia, was caused in 1876 when
the Near Eastern question became again an issue between Austria and
Russia. The latter's inquiries at <span class="pagenum"><a id="page132" name="page132"></a>(p. 132)</span> Berlin as to the German
attitude in a possible war between the other two empires were met with
an evasive answer, except that it was made clear that Germany would not
permit Russia to deal with Austria beyond a certain point. As a result
of this stand Russia decided to settle the Eastern question through a
war with Turkey rather than with Austria.</p>

<p>During the Russo-Turkish War, April, 1876, to February, 1877, the causes
and results of which will be considered in another place, Germany
maintained the strictest neutrality, so strict in fact that at its
conclusion Germany was chosen as mediator. To this part the young empire
adhered most carefully during the Congress of Berlin, June to July,
1878, and, difficult though it was, showed the strictest impartiality.
At the same time it refused to gain any profit from the readjustment
which resulted. In spite of this, however, it received little
appreciation on the part of Russia, which apparently had expected a more
active display of gratitude on the part of Germany for its own friendly
neutrality during the Franco-Prussian War. In a way this marks the
beginning of a strong anti-German feeling in Russia, which by 1879 had
grown strong enough to make a war between the two countries seem
possible. Bismarck immediately took the necessary steps to insure
Germany against such a possibility by concluding an alliance with
Austria, October 7, 1879, at Gastein. In this he was bitterly opposed by
William I, whose personal feelings were leaning much more toward Russia
than Austria. However, a threat on the part of the chancellor to resign
brought this rapidly aging emperor to terms.</p>

<p>The Austro-German alliance was defensive only. It stipulated that in
case of an attack by Russia on either contracting party the other was to
assist with its entire forces. In case of an attack by any other power
only friendly neutrality was to be observed, except if such a power was
in any way supported by Russia, when the first stipulation was to take
force.</p>

<p>Three years later, in 1882, Bismarck strengthened Germany's
international position by overcoming Italy's enmity against Austria to
the extent of inducing the southern kingdom to join in this defensive
alliance, which from then on was known as the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page133" name="page133"></a>(p. 133)</span> "Triple
Alliance," and which endured until Italy's declaration of war against
Austria in 1915. The chancellor had now succeeded in placing the
keystone in Germany's defensive bulwark. He had to fear no longer the
possibility of a joint attack by Russia and France. For the powerful
triple block of Central Powers would make any joining of forces by these
two countries impossible.</p>

<p>A result of this security was Germany's entrance among the colonial
powers of the world. The objects of this step were twofold: to open up
new fields for the rapidly expanding German trade, and to divert German
emigration in such a way that its steady stream would not drain the
Fatherland of too large a proportion of its surplus population. From
1884 on Germany used every opportune moment to acquire colonial
possessions. Though for many years none of the other powers seriously
objected, it was quite natural that sooner or later Germany would find
itself in conflict with the other colonizing powers, especially with the
greatest of all&mdash;England.</p>

<p>In 1884, Alexander III, who had succeeded his murdered father in 1881
and who was much less pro-German than the latter, showed signs of
succumbing to France's strenuous advances looking toward an alliance to
enable the republic to gratify its desire for revenge. But Bismarck's
diplomatic genius not only prevented this, but even brought about a
secret neutrality treaty between the two empires, which, however, was
entirely separate from the Triple Alliance.</p>

<p>Gradually, thus, the chancellor accomplished all that he had set out to
do after the formation of the German Empire to place his country, not
only among the great powers of the world, but to gain for it within
certain limitations, a leading position. With his internal policies he
was hardly less successful, although he had many hard battles to fight
to gain his end. The year 1888 saw him in the zenith of his power, and
Wilhelmstrasse (where the German Foreign Office was located) promised
fair to take the place that Downing Street had held. That year, however,
brought a change of rulers to Germany. In March William I died at the
age of ninety-one, and was succeeded by his son <span class="pagenum"><a id="page134" name="page134"></a>(p. 134)</span> Frederick III,
the son-in-law of Queen Victoria of England. This in itself endangered
Bismarck's position and influence. For ever since 1879 Frederick had
more or less openly allied himself with the National-Liberal party,
which strongly opposed the chancellor's foreign policy. The new emperor,
however, had been stricken with a mortal disease, which in 1878 was
diagnosed as cancer of the throat, and which resulted in his death on
June 15, 1888, less than four months after he had become emperor.</p>

<p>His son and successor, William II, was less than thirty years old, a
more or less unknown quantity, with little experience, but possessing a
very strongly individual temperament. The break between him and Bismarck
came soon, and resulted in the latter's resignation on March 18, 1890.
Germany could ill spare the master hand that had guided so successfully
its destinies since 1870, and at no time since has Germany's
international position been so strong or its foreign policies as
purposeful as under its first chancellor.</p>

<p>The second incumbent of this office was General von Caprivi, 1890-1894,
whose accomplishments were chiefly of a military and economic nature. Of
the former the most important was the change to the two years' term of
army service, of the latter the conclusion of commercial treaties with
Austria-Hungary, Russia, Italy, and Rumania. In the field of foreign
relations his term of office yielded the important result of a better
understanding with England, accompanied, however, by a lessening of
friendly relations with Russia. This period also brought to Germany the
island of Helgoland in exchange for certain readjustments of boundaries
in Africa. Bismarck's work in regard to cementing the German-Russian
relations was undone by the refusal of Germany to renew the secret
neutrality treaty which expired in 1890, and in 1891 Russia concluded an
alliance with France which from then on considerably reduced the
influence of the Triple Alliance. The menace of a France recovered and
supported by a strong ally again loomed up, and the dissatisfaction of
German public opinion, increased by the severe criticism of the retired
"iron chancellor," resulted finally in the resignation of Von Caprivi.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page135" name="page135"></a>(p. 135)</span> His successor, Prince Chlodwig Hohenlohe-Schillingfürst,
1894-1900, was an experienced diplomat, distantly related to the
emperor, and possessing much stronger convictions of his own. By this
time Germany's industrial development had made immense strides. From an
agricultural country it had changed to a nation deeply interested in
industry and commerce. Its merchants contended everywhere for the
world's trade. Articles of German manufacture made the term "made in
Germany" a by-word of quality and efficiency. Riches flowed into the
empire in a steady stream. Riches, however, were not the only result of
this development. The young empire began a fight for leadership in
manufacture and commerce, in science and the arts. To achieve these
ambitions, German agents and salesmen penetrated all countries, new and
old, and built up vast markets for German products, at the same time
using every means available to undermine and destroy the economic
influence of other nations. Nor was the empire contented with material
gain and new-found prestige; Germany abandoned its former policy of
concerning itself only with European affairs, and became a sinister and
unscrupulous opponent of other great powers in the dangerous game of
"world politics." We are not concerned here, however, with this feature
of Germany's advance, which is fully treated elsewhere.</p>

<p>This period brought out more and more the strong individuality of
William II, who had early&mdash;earlier, perhaps, than anyone
else&mdash;recognized his country's new needs, and who put all of his immense
vitality into his efforts to fill them. Some results were: the beginning
of a very definite and extensive naval program, the building and
completion (1895) of the Kaiser-Wilhelm Canal between the Baltic and the
North Sea, active participation in the development of Turkey in Europe
and Asia, the acquisition of a "sphere of influence" in China, and the
lease of Kiao-chau in 1897, the purchase of the Carolina Islands in
1899. All these activities brought Germany more and more frequently in
contact and often in conflict with English interests. Its naval
ambitions aroused the suspicions of the old mistress of the sea, and
relations which at no time since the death of William I had been
overcordial became more strained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page136" name="page136"></a>(p. 136)</span> In 1909, Prince Hohenlohe was succeeded by his Foreign
Secretary, Count, later Prince von Bülow. Though an experienced diplomat
and a man of great intelligence and culture, he found his road beset
with difficulties. Not only had he to face in international politics at
every step the dual alliance of France and Russia, which was becoming
rapidly more intimate, but English aversion against German independence
in matters of world politics, and English resentment against German
expansion grew day by day. The culmination of this general dread of
German ascendancy found expression in the formation of the Anglo-French
<i>entente cordiale</i> of 1904 and the Anglo-Russian arrangement of 1907, of
which we shall hear more when considering the histories of the three
countries directly involved. Whether or not the German claim that these
agreements were concluded with the ulterior motives of isolating and
then crushing Germany and her allies had foundations, is of little
importance. For the fact remains that they were considered in this
light, not only by Germany's diplomats, but by the nation at large, and
ever after Germany's foreign policy was based on this consideration.</p>

<p>Even before England had actually come to a definite understanding with
Russia, the first test was put to the new line-up of the European
powers. In 1905 trouble arose about the extension of French influence in
North Africa. Although a general European war seemed more possible at
that time than at any other time within recent years, it was averted as
a result of the so-called Algeciras Conference. In this first inning
Germany won together with Italy and Austria against France, backed by
Russia and England, and the result was the declaration of Morocco's
integrity.</p>

<a id="img006" name="img006"></a>

<p>Europe in Twelfth Century, Historical Map.</p></div>

<p>During the next decade the foreign policy of Germany showed the same
chief characteristic that was noticeable in that of the other
countries&mdash;high tension. One is almost tempted to compare this period of
Europe's history to the hours immediately preceding a violent electrical
storm. The diplomatic atmosphere was surcharged with electricity, and
long before the storm really broke the growl of distant thunder could be
heard and occasional flashes of lightning announced its approach. That,
in spite of all signs, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page138" name="page138"></a>(p. 138)</span> so many people firmly believed that the
storm would never break, is easily explained with the innate optimism of
mankind, and is on a par with the spirit of unbelief in unpleasant
things that makes people go out unprepared for rain, as long as rain
only threatens, but does not actually fall.</p>

<p>In 1911, Morocco again almost became the stumblingblock. In that year
France annexed this north African country in spite of the agreement that
had been reached at Algeciras. Germany immediately entered a strong
protest, which, however, was later withdrawn in consideration of certain
commercial privileges in connection with the development of the country,
and the cession of territory in central Africa. Once more war had been
avoided.</p>

<p>This period also saw numerous upheavals in the Balkans. Throughout these
Germany made it clear that it would permit nothing in that part of the
world which would work out to the disadvantage of its ally&mdash;Austria.</p>

<p>In spite of temporary reduction in the tension existing between Germany
on the one hand, and England, France, and Russia respectively on the
other, the differences between these countries became more marked,
diplomatic clashes more frequent, and their mutual suspicion of each
other more pronounced. England especially resented the ambitious naval
program of Germany, which seriously threatened British supremacy on the
sea and forced England to tremendous expenditures to maintain its
overwhelming naval strength. France was menaced by Germany's increase in
the peace strength of its army, which was accomplished in 1913 by means
of special taxation known as the "Wehrbeitrag."</p>

<p>The German-French relations were influenced considerably, not only by
French colonial policy, but also by conditions in Alsace-Lorraine. We
have already heard of the French attitude in regard to these so-called
"lost provinces." Right after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71, and
for a considerable period afterward, the desire for restitution and the
demand for the reconquest of the lost territory undoubtedly was as
sincere as it was widespread among the French nation. It is, however, no
less true that these sentiments decreased in fervor, and most <span class="pagenum"><a id="page139" name="page139"></a>(p. 139)</span>
likely would have subsided entirely if they would have been permitted to
take their natural course. Instead of this, this question gradually
became a political issue of the first magnitude, and now one political
party and then another would use it for its own purposes. It was thus
that the French-German animosity was kept alive and nurtured. On the
German side the more or less uncompromising attitude toward all things
French as far as Alsace-Lorraine was officially claimed to be a matter
of political necessity. At any rate it gave continual opportunities to
French politicians to make capital out of the conditions as they existed
in Alsace-Lorraine. One of the most severe outbreaks of anti-German and
antimilitary feeling in that part of the German Empire happened in
December, 1913, in the small Alsatian garrison town of Zabern, when some
Alsatians of French antecedents and sympathizers were wounded in a clash
with German officers and soldiers. Unimportant as this affair was, in a
way, it resulted in a great deal of very pointed and unfriendly comment
in the French press, and undoubtedly added fuel to the fire of
Franco-German animosity which was burning even then stronger than it had
done for many years.</p>

<p>In 1908, near the end of Prince von Bülow's incumbency of the
chancellorship, his position became very difficult, because of the
general disapproval on the part of the nation of the German emperor's
custom to make long speeches concerning foreign affairs. Some of these
speeches caused a considerable amount of offense in foreign capitals,
and, while this matter, too, may be considered a minor detail in
Germany's relations with foreign powers, it had at the same time some
influence. Throughout this period the chancellor was supported by a
combination of the National-Liberal and Conservative parties. But in
1909 the continuation of this combination became impossible on account
of the divergence of opinion existing between these two parties in
regard to the Government's financial reforms. The National-Liberal as
well as the Social-Democrat and other radical members of the Finance
Committee withdrew, and the Conservatives formed a new combination with
the Center party. This new majority, however, made so many changes in
the original Government <span class="pagenum"><a id="page140" name="page140"></a>(p. 140)</span> bill, and forced through measures
which the chancellor so thoroughly disapproved, that he handed his
resignation to the emperor. It was not accepted right away, but upon his
continued insistence, he finally was permitted to resign in July. His
successor was Dr. von Bethmann-Hollweg, up to then Minister of the
Interior of Prussia, a member of an old patrician house with strong
National-Liberal tendencies.</p>

<p>In 1910 the Far Eastern problem again became acute. Russia, Japan, and
England, of course, were most vitally interested in the future of China.
Both France and Germany, too, had important commercial interests. For a
time it looked as if these great powers would clash about the Chinese
question, which each wished to solve in such a manner that the greatest
possible advantage and gain would come to itself and none or the least
possible to the others. However, in 1910 the United States proposed that
the Manchurian railway, just then the principal issue, be financed by an
international syndicate, reasserting, thereby, its previous stand for an
"open-door" policy in China. Germany supported this attitude, and
undoubtedly did not make through this action any friendships among the
other powers.</p>

<p>In May, 1911, the Reichstag, after long discussion, accepted a bill
giving a separate constitution to Alsace-Lorraine, making, thereby, this
territory more equal to the other parts of the German Empire. This
action, of course, was welcomed by the inhabitants of Alsace-Lorraine,
and was a long step toward reconciling them sometime to the German
overlordship. In the same degree in which it accomplished this it caused
displeasure in France, where, by this time, every success in the
Germanizing of the "lost provinces" was viewed naturally with almost as
much disapproval as the original occupation.</p>

<p>It was in the same year, 1911, that the Morocco difficulties arose again
with France, as we have already seen, but in spite of the appearance of
a German gunboat at the port of Agadir and the threatening attitude of
Germany, matters were finally settled amicably. The terms of the
settlement, however, pleased neither the German nor the French nation at
large, and a considerable feeling of enmity remained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page141" name="page141"></a>(p. 141)</span> Late that year, 1911, a determined campaign was started by the
German Navy League in an effort to bring about an increase of Germany's
naval forces through the force of public opinion. This activity, which
met with considerable success, was viewed with alarm and displeasure in
England. These sentiments grew and spread to France when in the spring
of 1912 the newly elected Reichstag adopted a bill carrying greatly
increased expenditures for both army and navy.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1912 the Balkan question, which is treated in detail in
a separate chapter, assumed threatening proportions. Germany as well as
the other great powers, however, at that time managed to find a common
basis and kept all from active participation in the two Balkan wars,
restricting their activities to the exertion of their various influences
for as just a settlement as was possible under the circumstances when
the time for settlement had arrived in 1913. In spite of the inactivity
of the powers there can be no doubt that their respective attitudes at
that time toward the various Balkan States and their ambitions had an
important influence on the latter's attitude toward the various powers
after the war of 1914 had broken out.</p>

<p>In December, 1912, the Triple Alliance was renewed, although even then
the conflicting interests of Italy and Austria in the Balkans had made
such a step somewhat doubtful.</p>

<p>The early spring of 1913 brought with it the uncovering of a rather
extensive scandal in connection with the manufacture of guns and other
war materials. One of the Socialistic leaders in the Reichstag charged
some officials of the great munition firm of Krupp and of other firms
with bribery of War Department officials, and with the creation of
artificial war scares in other countries for the sake of increasing
munition orders. Although the German courts later sustained this
contention to a certain extent, and although it resulted in a certain
amount of antiwar sentiment, Germany continued with its well-defined
program of increased preparedness. That the Government had behind it in
its efforts the full support of public opinion was proven in June of the
same year, 1913, by the passage in the Reichstag of another bill
carrying considerable increases in the peace strength <span class="pagenum"><a id="page142" name="page142"></a>(p. 142)</span> of the
army, and by the fact that the necessary expenditures were met by
special taxation, which, though severe in its effects alike on poor and
rich, was borne cheerfully by the entire nation.</p>

<p>Although the Balkan question continued to be the source of considerable
anxiety and extensive diplomatic conferences, the political horizon of
Europe during the latter half of 1913 and the first half of 1914 seemed
comparatively cloudless to all but the keenest observers. Like a flash
of lightning out of a clear sky, therefore, came the news that the heir
to the throne of Austria-Hungary, Archduke Francis Ferdinand, and his
wife, the Duchess of Hohenberg, had been assassinated during a visit to
Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia, June 28, 1914, and that the Austrian
Government had determined to hold Serbia responsible. England, France,
Russia, and Serbia tried, in vain, during the next five weeks to check
the outbreak of a general European war.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>




<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="title">AUSTRIA-HUNGARY</p>


<p>Amongst the great European nations the Austro-Hungarian Empire occupies
a unique position. In number of inhabitants it is inferior only to
Russia and Germany, whereas it occupies more territory than any other
European country, with the single exception of Russia. In spite of this,
however, Austria-Hungary possesses no foreign colonies, and those of its
inhabitants who, for one reason or another, decided to leave the land of
their birth, have, therefore, for years emigrated to foreign countries,
and have been lost, in large numbers, to their native country. Of
course, the desire for expansion, which is one of the chief
characteristics of the historical development of the various nations
during the twentieth century, made itself felt in Austria-Hungary as
well as everywhere else. Not having any colonies and not having either
the financial or military means of acquiring any, the Dual Monarchy has
for many years been <span class="pagenum"><a id="page143" name="page143"></a>(p. 143)</span> deeply interested in the Near East. There
vast stretches of undeveloped territory, much of which was immediately
adjoining its own territory, created a strong desire for possession, or
at least for a preponderating influence. This desire was intensified by
the peculiar racial conditions which existed in the Dual Monarchy.</p>

<p>Austria-Hungary in this respect also differed from all the other
European nations. In each one of the other countries of Europe there was
<i>one</i> race that was more numerous and more influential than any of the
other races that might inhabit the same country. In Austria-Hungary,
however, there were living side by side a number of widely different
races. Germans, Bohemians, Poles, Hungarians, Serbians, and others. Of
most of these races additional numbers were living in one or another of
the adjoining countries, and this condition brought about a continuous
desire on the part of these different nations to unite. For instance,
the Poles living in Austrian Galicia never gave up their hope of once
more becoming united with their fellow Poles in Prussian and in Russian
Poland. In the same way the Rumanians in the Austrian province of
Bukowina cast longing eyes toward Rumania and Russian Bessarabia; the
Austrian Serbs did the same in respect to Serbia and so on.</p>

<p>All attempts of the Government to change this condition appeared to be
futile, whether these attempts were of a friendly or of a hostile and
oppressive nature. Legislature of any kind, as long as it affected
racial questions, was not only unsuccessful in accomplishing its ends,
but often resulted in bitter parliamentary discussions and hostilities.
The resentment of the various racial units of the Dual Monarchy against
such legislation was only deepened by the fact that for many years the
actual power of government lay in the hands of the Germanic part of the
empire in spite of the fact that the Germans, though in many ways the
most advanced, were the least numerous.</p>

<p>In view of all these conditions it is rather remarkable that the Dual
Monarchy should have held together as long as it did and, indeed, its
disruption was frequently prophesied and as frequently <span class="pagenum"><a id="page144" name="page144"></a>(p. 144)</span>
expected. It is clear, therefore, why every attempt on the part of the
different Balkan nations to readjust their affairs deeply interested and
affected Austria-Hungary. For, even if the empire had given up all
thought of profiting itself by such a readjustment, there was always the
danger that it might lose both in territory and population. Such a loss,
however small, would have seriously embarrassed the Dual Monarchy. For
not only might it have resulted in further losses of the same nature,
but also from a financial point of view the empire could not afford a
diminution of any of its resources. As national wealth goes,
Austria-Hungary cannot be considered rich by any means, being in this
respect almost on an equal basis with Italy, which has only two-thirds
the number of inhabitants and less than one-half the extent of the Dual
Monarchy.</p>

<p>Considering the many difficult problems of political, financial and
economic nature which the possession of colonies created for the various
colonial powers of Europe, Austria might have considered itself
fortunate because of its entire lack of colonies. However, the problem
of Balkan readjustments, upon which we have touched just now, took the
place of colonial problems and brought to Austria as many difficulties
and entanglements as any colony has ever brought to its possessor. It
was along that line that Austria-Hungary was brought into contact with
the other nations of Europe. Of these Russia was the one most vitally
interested in the same questions as Austria. For of almost every race
that inhabited Austria additional numbers were living in Russia and
whatever one country did or attempted to do in the Near East was looked
upon with suspicion by the other. Turkey, too, of course, was vitally
interested and affected by Austria's policy in the Near East and so was
England ever since its foreign policy had been committed to the
principle of keeping the Near Eastern <i>status quo</i> undisturbed.</p>

<p>Outside of these possibilities of becoming involved with another nation
the Dual Monarchy had long-standing difficulties with Italy. For,
previous to the creation of the present kingdom of Italy, Austria had
possessed large parts of northern Italy, and the loss of these fertile
and rich territories was a severe blow <span class="pagenum"><a id="page145" name="page145"></a>(p. 145)</span> to Austria. The enmity
between the two countries was still more enhanced when, in 1866, Austria
had to give up Venetia to Italy. This loss was an indirect result of the
Prusso-Austrian War of 1866, the details of which we have already
mentioned in the recital of the political development of Germany.
Previous to declaring war against Austria, Prussia had formed an
alliance with Italy and at the beginning of hostilities between Prussia
and Austria Italy, too, attacked Austria. Although the Austrian troops
defeated the Italians, Austria was forced, when peace was concluded, to
yield Venetia to Italy retaining only a small part of its former
possessions on the Adriatic so as not to be cut off entirely from a
maritime outlet. This small remnant of its former Italian possessions,
however, proved to be a thorn in the body politic of the Dual Monarchy.
The inhabitants of this province were preponderately Italian in language
and Italian in feeling and ever since the formation of the kingdom of
Italy a strong propaganda was carried on with the object of finally
accomplishing the redemption of these provinces from Austrian rule and
their unification with Italy.</p>

<p>In spite of the difficulties between Austria on one side and Russia and
Italy respectively on the other it seemed, soon after the
Franco-Prussian war of 1870, as if all these difficulties would be
adjusted in an amicable way. In 1872 the three European Emperors of
Germany, Austria and Russia met and without actually concluding a treaty
arrived at a mutual understanding which promised well for the future
peace of Europe. Five years later in 1877 when Russia went to war with
Turkey the definite result of this mutual understanding was a treaty
concluded between Russia and Austria. As a result of this treaty Austria
agreed not to interfere between Turkey and Russia whereas Russia
promised to Austria Bosnia and Herzegovina, both of which were at that
time under the rule of Turkey. This latter promise was kept in 1878,
when the various Balkan questions that had become acute through the
Turko-Russian War were adjusted at the Berlin Congress. It is true that
at that time Austria was only permitted to occupy these territories, but
even this was a considerable acquisition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page146" name="page146"></a>(p. 146)</span> Four years later another step was taken toward the
strengthening of European peace. In that year the treaty which had been
concluded in 1879 between Germany and Italy was extended to include
Austria-Hungary and this alliance of the three Central European Powers,
known commonly as the Triple Alliance, endured not only till the
outbreak of the war of 1914, but even for some time later. This alliance
originally was made only for five years, but at the expiration of this
time it was renewed in 1887 and again later.</p>

<p>Of the causes and results of the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 we have
heard already in the consideration of Germany's history. Immediately
after its conclusion Austria-Hungary devoted its energies chiefly to
internal affairs and in 1867 succeeded in a reorganization of the
difficulties which had arisen with Hungary. The result was the
"Ausgleich" which established Hungary practically on an equal basis with
Austria, giving it a separate constitution, legislature and cabinet. It
is from this dual basis that the term "Dual Monarchy" was derived and
the arrangement made then fundamentally is in existence to-day.</p>

<p>Throughout the ensuing years Austria-Hungary's position and influence
amongst the great European powers was of little direct importance. In
the first place the Dual Monarchy was occupied continuously with the
most vexing internal questions caused by the incessant difficulties
arising between its racially different population. These were
responsible for the fall of one ministry after another, and frequently
caused grave apprehension to all Europe. For many years the
disintegration of the empire was feared and expected. But in spite of
all difficulties it held together. In the second place the country
remained for many years chiefly agricultural and even to-day,
considering its extent, is only moderately industrial. This made it
unnecessary for Austria-Hungary to concern itself directly with such
questions as the colonization of Africa or the division of China. Only
occasionally it made its influence felt indirectly by supporting the
policies and claims of its two allies, Germany and Italy.</p>

<p>In 1908, however, it took a step that immediately brought it into the
center of world politics. In that year the annexation <span class="pagenum"><a id="page147" name="page147"></a>(p. 147)</span> of
Bosnia-Herzegovina was announced, although for many years previous the
Turkish suzerainty over these two provinces had been less than nominal.
As this was followed immediately by a declaration of independence on the
part of Bulgaria, the jealousy of Serbia was aroused. But both the
difficulties with this country and with Turkey about the annexation were
finally adjusted, mainly through the strong support which Germany gave
to its ally and in 1909 all of the powers recognized the annexation.</p>

<p>Once more Austria-Hungary withdrew from the international concert and
devoted itself to its internal difficulties which seemed to increase in
frequency and violence as the years passed by. It was not until the
summer of 1912 that it again became active in connection with foreign
politics. Then, when the Balkan question had become acute, the Austrian
Foreign Minister, Count Berchtold, suggested to the other powers that
they combine for the purpose of settling the Balkan disputes. The
suggestion was accepted and although it did not succeed in avoiding war
between the different Balkan States themselves, it, at least, localized
this war and kept the rest of Europe out of it.</p>

<p>Of course, Austrian diplomats were busily occupied throughout this
entire period in guarding their country's interests, and Constantinople
especially was the scene of many a diplomatic battle between
Austria-Hungary and the other powers. From time to time relations with
Russia became somewhat strained on account of the conflicting interests
of the two countries in the Balkans. But in spite of this conditions
were friendly enough to permit an arrangement between these two powers
in March, 1913, whereby they agreed on the demobilization of their
respective forces along the Russo-Austrian border.</p>

<p>The murder of Archduke Francis Ferdinand, heir to the throne, and his
wife during a visit at Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia, however, changed
immediately Austria-Hungary's attitude toward Serbia. Like one man the
country rose and demanded the punishment of the murderers and of the
nation which, it was claimed, had planned and financed the murder,
Serbia. Racial differences and dissensions of long <span class="pagenum"><a id="page148" name="page148"></a>(p. 148)</span> standing
were forgotten and forgiven over night, as it were, and a country, more
solidified than at any other period in its history, stood behind its
Emperor Francis Joseph, a man who throughout his life of more than
eighty years&mdash;of which more than three-fourths were spent on the
throne&mdash;had suffered all the disappointments and sorrows that can come
to a man, but had never lost the trust and love of his subjects.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>




<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="title">RUSSIA</p>


<p>In the middle of the nineteenth century the Russian Empire, in spite of
its vast extent and resources, played a comparatively negligible part in
international politics. To a certain extent this was the result of the
Crimean War. But still more was it due to the internal difficulties
which were so many and so serious that they kept the empire fully
occupied for a considerable period.</p>

<p>This condition is easily understood if we remember that at that time of
all the great European nations Russia was the least developed, the least
advanced, and the least modernized. The many reforms instituted at that
time contributed their share in changing this condition and resulted in
bringing the Russian Empire rapidly to the forefront of European
nations. With the details of the reforms we are not concerned, but as
their actual accomplishment had an important bearing on Russia's future
activities in the field of world politics it will be well to state that
they consisted chiefly of five great measures: the emancipation of the
serfs; the institution of the zemstvos or county councils; trial by
jury; regulation of the public press; and reorganization of the army.
Some of these reforms were instituted by the government only after
public opinion had made such a course inevitable, and of the history of
this entire period it may well be said that it was written in the very
lifeblood of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page149" name="page149"></a>(p. 149)</span> the Russian people. Two forces continuously
combated each other; on one side were the large masses of the people, on
the other the ruling classes. The former it is true were not always in
solid union and, indeed, more frequently left the burden of fighting
their cause to a small group of intellectuals. Their demands in many
instances were unreasonable, but the ruling classes were just as
unreasonable in their attitude, and the result was a period of terrorism
during which assassination of officials abounded and even the life of
the emperor was threatened a number of times.</p>

<p>During the war of 1866 between Prussia and Austria and in 1871 between
France and Germany, Russia observed a friendly neutrality toward
Prussia. This attitude was the outcome of the long-standing personal
friendship between the Russian and Prussian dynasties, a condition which
at that period counted much more than in more modern times. Although
Russia kept out of any active participation in these two struggles it
used the Franco-Prussian War, when all the other European powers were
tied down by its possibilities, to declare, in October, 1870, that it
refused to be bound further by the provisions of the treaty of Paris,
made in 1856, establishing the neutrality of the Black Sea. As a result
of this a conference was called to London the following year, 1871,
which affirmed in the name of all powers represented their determination
to respect the sanctity of treaties, but in spite of that rescinded the
treaty of 1856 along the lines of Russia's demands, and the neutrality
of the Black Sea was abolished. A few years later a separate arrangement
between Russia and Turkey made it possible for both of these powers to
create and maintain separate fleets in the Black Sea.</p>

<p>In 1872, as we have already heard, the three European emperors of
Russia, Austria, and Germany met at Berlin and possibly as a result of
that meeting a treaty was signed in 1873 between Germany and Russia
which, however, bearing as it did only the signatures of the two
emperors and of the heads of their respective general staffs, had
neither a real standing nor an important influence in the affairs of
either country.</p>

<a id="img008" name="img008"></a>
<div class="figcenter">

<p>Europe in 1648-1789, Historical Map.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page151" name="page151"></a>(p. 151)</span> Two years later, in 1875, Russia once more acted in concert
with Austria and Germany when the Governments of these three empires
addressed a joint request to Turkey asking for the immediate institution
of reforms in the Balkan dependencies of the Turkish Empire which were
then the center of continuous upheavals and threatened to disrupt
European peace.</p>

<p>Before we continue the consideration of Russia's political history it
will be well to emphasize the chief characteristics of Russian foreign
policy. In western European politics Russia had no direct interest. In
the Near East, however, it was more directly interested than any other
European power with the possible exception of Austria-Hungary; for not
only were most of the European dependencies of Turkey inhabited by
Slavish people or else by races closely related to them, but it was
there also that Russia hoped to gain its much-needed ice-free seaport.
This strong interest of Russia in Balkan affairs which will be brought
out in greater detail in another place, devoted exclusively to the
Balkan question, naturally brought it continuously in contact with
Austria-Hungary. For the latter's interest in these matters was as
strong as was Russia's, although it was, as we have seen, based on
different grounds. This condition then meant that there was nothing in
the way of a strong friendship or even a possible alliance between
Germany and Russia except Germany's friendship for and alliance with
Austria-Hungary which made it impossible for Germany to support Russia's
policy in the Balkans. As a secondary result of this obstacle to a
Russo-German alliance may be considered the gradual approachment between
France and Russia.</p>

<p>In one other part of the world Russia's interest was very strong and
that was in the Far East. Here it clashed with equally strong or even
stronger interests which England and Japan had and it took many years
before these three powers finally arrived at an understanding concerning
their several spheres of interest in the Far East.</p>

<p>Immediately following Russia's participation in asking reforms of Turkey
for its Balkan dependencies Pan-Slavism increased rapidly and greatly in
Russia. One of the most <span class="pagenum"><a id="page152" name="page152"></a>(p. 152)</span> peculiar features of this movement is
the fact that the Russian Government suppressed with all the power at
its command and with all the severity within its knowledge this movement
as far as it affected internal affairs, but supported it just as
strongly as far as it affected the affairs of other countries. The
growth of Pan-Slavism finally resulted in April, 1877, in Russia's
declaration of war against Turkey.</p>

<p>In this war Russia was victorious, but only through the support which it
received from Rumania, Serbia, Bulgaria, and Montenegro. In spite of
repeated appeals on the part of Turkey to the other European powers
these did not step in until Turkey was almost threatened with entire
elimination. Then a conference of the European powers was called at
Berlin and resulted in July, 1878, in the Treaty of Berlin which took
the place of a treaty previously arranged between Russia and Turkey in
March, 1878, at San Stefano. The Treaty of Berlin gave to Russia certain
small parts of Turkey, but successfully reduced the excessively strong
influence over Balkan affairs which Russia had attempted to gain for
itself in the Treaty of San Stefano.</p>

<p>In spite of the difficulties between Austria and Russia, of which we
have spoken, the two countries had arrived, previous to the outbreak of
the Russo-Turkish War, at an understanding according to which Austria
maintained a friendly neutrality toward Russia during the war, in
consideration of which Russia permitted Austria's occupation of Bosnia
and Herzegovina.</p>

<p>The following years are again marked by internal difficulties resulting
in a reign of terrorism and in a period of reactionary government which
exceed almost anything in Russia's previous history. It found its
culmination in the successful assassination of Czar Alexander II on
March 13, 1881. He was succeeded by his son Alexander III under whose
rule the gulf between Russia and its western neighbors, Germany and
Austria, widened in the same proportion as the friendship between Russia
on one side and France and England on the other increased. To a certain
extent undoubtedly this may be traced back to the new czar's personal
relations with the rulers of other nations; for <span class="pagenum"><a id="page153" name="page153"></a>(p. 153)</span> the czarina
was a sister of Alexandria of Denmark, then Princess of Wales and later
Queen of England, and the daughter of that King of Denmark who in 1864
had lost to Germany and Austria Schleswig-Holstein.</p>

<p>The beginning of Alexander III's reign was marked with the beginning of
a series of terrible persecutions of the Jewish inhabitants of the
Russian Empire which, though subsiding from time to time, have continued
throughout the years until the present time. With the causes of these
persecutions we are not concerned here, for they were undoubtedly much
more of an economic than of a political nature. In one respect, however,
the results had an important bearing, at least for a time, on Russian
politics. For during many years both France and especially England found
it difficult and almost next to impossible to enter into a close
alliance with a country which apparently absolutely refused to
acknowledge some of the most fundamental principles of modern government
in which they themselves believed: religious and personal freedom.</p>

<p>With Alexander III came also a return to a more reactionary form of
government which in its turn brought about a revival of terrorism and
Nihilism with all its horrors and bloodshed. In spite of the continuance
of these conditions in Russian internal affairs Russia participated
actively in the general movement for expansion which made itself felt in
the latter decade of the nineteenth century. Its interest in Near
Eastern affairs became deeper and more active and its advances in the
Far East kept step. In the Near East, however, Russia found determined
opposition and the gradual development of the independent states of
Rumania, Bulgaria, Serbia, and Greece, most of which were formed, at
least partly, out of what was once the Turkish Empire, made it clearer
and clearer every day that Russia's hope for gaining a maritime outlet
through the conquest of Constantinople would never be realized. Though
never giving up entirely this hope Russia's endeavors turned more and
more toward the Far East. One of the most important results of this new
policy was the beginning of the construction of the Trans-Siberian
Railway in May, 1891.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page154" name="page154"></a>(p. 154)</span> The same year, 1891, saw the visit of a large French fleet at
Kronstadt, the harbor of Petrograd, which was welcomed effusively. Two
years later, in 1893, a Russian fleet repaid the compliment by visiting
Toulon and found an equally hospitable reception. Even previous to this
a large amount of French capital had been invested in Russian Government
Bonds and in Russian industrial undertakings and the friendship between
the two nations increased rapidly. However, the death of Alexander III
in November, 1894, somewhat delayed the actual conclusion of the
alliance and it was not until 1896 that an extensive and far-reaching
treaty was signed at the occasion of the visit of the new Czar, Nicholas
II, to Paris. The immense significance which this Franco-Russian treaty
had in respect to its effect on all of Europe was immediately
recognized. If the treaty succeeded in lasting for any length of time,
it was reasonably clear that it would be only a question of time before
it would result in an entirely new arrangement of European affairs.</p>

<p>The next five or six years were characterized by Russia's determined
advances in the Far East, a strengthening of the Franco-Russian
friendship and serious internal difficulties. The first of these brought
Russia more and more in conflict with England and Japan of which we
shall hear more immediately. The second resulted in a growth of the
estrangement between Russia and Germany. The third for a time threatened
the very existence of the Russian monarchy and it seemed almost
impossible that anything else than revolution and anarchy could be the
final outcome. These were averted only at the last moment by the
outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War.</p>

<p>In April, 1902, a treaty had been signed between China and Russia.
According to it Russia agreed to observe the integrity of China and to
evacuate Manchuria which it had begun to occupy as early as 1897. The
evacuation was to be stretched over a year and a half and in the
beginning Russia lived up to the terms of the treaty. At the end of the
first six months, however, further evacuation stopped and when China
demanded explanations Russia repudiated the arrangement and refused to
proceed with <span class="pagenum"><a id="page155" name="page155"></a>(p. 155)</span> the evacuation unless additional concessions were
made by China. Throughout 1903 negotiations took place between Japan and
Russia concerning this matter which, however, were not very rich in
results. On January 13, 1904, the Japanese Government, therefore, sent
what amounted practically to an ultimatum in regard to Manchuria and
Corea. This step was followed immediately by warlike preparations on the
part of both nations. Three weeks later on February 6, 1904, diplomatic
relations between the two countries were broken off and the
Russo-Japanese War was on. The Japanese showed themselves superior to
their European adversaries in every respect, and, after inflicting
severe defeats on land and sea, peace was concluded on September 5,
1905, at Portsmouth, U. S. A. The Japanese were very moderate in their
terms, waiving their demand for an indemnity, returning to Russia all
interned warships and not insisting on any restriction to Russian power
in the Far East.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile affairs at home had progressed rapidly toward
revolution. The defeat of the Russian army and fleet, the discovery of
immense peculations in connection with their equipment and an increase
of economic pressure, all combined to hasten the outbreak which had been
preparing for years. Strikes, riots, assassination of officials and
general bloodshed were the common order of the day. At the very
beginning of these outbreaks a manifest of the czar promised some
reforms. However, he made it clear that in a general way the Government
was resolved to retain its autocratic form. In a way this manifest is a
true picture of the cool attitude which the Government took throughout
these troublous times. Whenever the Government was forced by especially
violent outbreaks to fear the worst, it would announce the introduction
of some slight reforms. This usually had the desired result of calming
down, at least temporarily, the excited masses, which condition would be
followed almost immediately either by a withdrawal of the reforms
instituted or by some reactionary laws offsetting their influence. In a
general way the revolution, however, improved somewhat internal
conditions in Russia. It led to the establishment <span class="pagenum"><a id="page156" name="page156"></a>(p. 156)</span> of a
representative form of government by the creation of the Duma, although
the limits within which the people were allowed to participate in
governmental affairs were and are even now very narrow. In fact it was
not an unusual procedure for the Government to imprison members of the
Duma and to accuse them of treason whenever they promulgated or
supported measures of which the Government did not approve, and
throughout the following years up to the present time the struggle
between a frankly reactionary government and the people demanding more
liberty continued.</p>

<p>One of the centers of disturbances was Finland. This former province of
Sweden had been ceded to Russia by the Scandinavian Kingdom as long ago
as 1743, after having been practically conquered in 1714. At that time
certain rights of independency and autonomy were granted to Finland.
Throughout the next century and a half Russia lived up to these promises
in a fashion. But in 1899 the Finnish Diet was deprived of its exclusive
right of legislating for the former grand duchy, and Russia started on a
policy of Russification; although the conqueror did not differ to any
noticeable extent from other nations who found themselves in similar
positions&mdash;Prussia and Austria in Poland, Germany in Alsace-Lorraine,
England in some of its colonies&mdash;Russia had to contend with greater
opposition, perhaps, than any of them. For the Finns were a people to
whom liberty was as dear as life or even dearer and no particle of it
would they give up except if an overwhelming power forced them to do so.
One Russian governor general after another became the victim of
assassination. This fact is of particular interest to us only because it
resulted in a deep-seated hatred of Russia and all things Russian on the
part of all Swedes, indeed, of all Scandinavians who, though Finland had
been separated from them for three or four generations, still considered
this unhappy country to be part and parcel of Scandinavia. To a great
extent this explains the Scandinavian attitude toward Russia of which we
shall hear more presently.</p>

<p>Among the more prominent men of Russia who fell under assassins'
assaults were Von Plehve, Minister of the Interior, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page157" name="page157"></a>(p. 157)</span> Grand
Duke Sergius, an uncle of the czar, both typical reactionaries and men
whose death may well be claimed a gain for Russia rather than a loss. In
this period also belongs the killing of hundreds of workingmen of
Petrograd who, led by a Russian priest, Father Capon, attempted to march
to the Winter Palace of their "Little Father," the Czar, in order to
present to him in person their petition for relief from their many
oppressions. Similar scenes were repeated in Warsaw, in Lodz and in
other Russian industrial centers during 1905. Step by step the
revolution of the people seemed to gain in spite of all efforts of the
Government. It even spread to the army and navy and at Odessa the crew
of a large battleship mutinied, seized the boat and bombarded the city,
killing more than a thousand of its inhabitants. Strikes broke out in
different parts of the country. Troops murdered their officers and went
over to the cause of the people. Nevertheless the Government finally
triumphed, partly by diplomatically granting&mdash;temporarily only, of
course&mdash;some of the demands of the masses, but chiefly by force and
unrelenting severity. The latter policy brought about the fall of one of
the most able statesmen that Russia had ever produced, Count Witte, who
was then Prime Minister and to whose diplomacy and ability Russia owed
primarily its easy bargain with Japan after the latter country's
victory.</p>

<p>The next year, 1906, however, brought some relief to the sorely
oppressed people. The peasants were enabled to acquire the land which
heretofore they had tilled almost like slaves for the benefit of the
great landowners belonging to the aristocratic and patrician classes.
All were made equal before the law, oppressive taxes and restrictions
concerning the choice of residence on the part of peasants were removed
and certain electoral reforms were promulgated. The latter, however,
were of short duration, for in 1907, when things had quieted down a bit
they were either recalled or nullified by technical interpretations
which thoroughly defeated their original purposes.</p>

<p>During this entire period the persecution of Jews was kept up. In spite
of this, however, Russia took prompt steps to stop similar persecutions
of Armenians on the part of Turks, one of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page158" name="page158"></a>(p. 158)</span> the few undertakings
of the Russian Government of that time which deserves the approval of
mankind.</p>

<p>In August of the same year, 1907, Russia also arrived at an
understanding with England concerning the respective spheres of
influence of these two countries in Asia, an important step toward the
completion of the "Triple Entente" of Russia, England, and France.</p>

<p>The year 1908 was noticeable only for the enaction of further
reactionary measures. The next year, 1909, saw Russia's participation in
the successful effort of the European powers to adjust pacifically the
various questions that had arisen from Bulgaria's proclamation as a
kingdom and Austria-Hungary's annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. In the
same year, 1909, the Russian advance for the possession of Persia
began&mdash;without opposition on the part of England by that time&mdash;and an
understanding was reached between the czar's and the Chinese Government
concerning the Manchurian railroad. This made it possible for Russia in
the following year, 1910, to reject the suggestion of the United States
Government to internationalize this railroad, in which attitude Russia
had the support of Japan, England and France.</p>

<p>During the Franco-German difficulties about Morocco in 1911 Russia put
itself squarely on the side of France and its announcement to that
effect, made officially to the German Government, was a decided step
forward toward French intimacy and German enmity. Having helped out
France in this manner, Russia promptly pushed its own cause in Persia.
With England and France indifferent to this unfortunate country's fate,
with Germany not sufficiently interested to risk a break with any or all
of the members of the "Triple Entente," and with the United States much
in the same position as Germany, Russia had its own way and Persia had
to submit to Russia's demands and to its gradual enslavement under
Russian rule.</p>

<p>In 1912 and 1913&mdash;before, during and after the two Balkan Wars&mdash;Russia
acted in concert with the other European powers and refrained from
active participation although its sympathies were clearly enough with
Serbia. So promising was the outlook <span class="pagenum"><a id="page159" name="page159"></a>(p. 159)</span> then for a lasting
understanding between the nations of Europe that Russia and Austria
found it possible&mdash;as we have already heard&mdash;to agree, in March, 1913,
on a demobilization of their armies along their respective borders.</p>

<p>A little more than a year, however, sufficed to bring about a change in
this friendly attitude of the two empires, a change fateful alike to
both and to all the world. For one day after Austria-Hungary's
declaration of war against Serbia on July 28, 1914, Russia began her
mobilization&mdash;a necessary measure with Austria at war for increased
power in the Balkans. By July 31, 1914, Russia's general mobilization
had taken place.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>




<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="title">FRANCE</p>


<p>The chief characteristic of the second empire established after Napoleon
III's coup d'état in 1852 was expansion. Napoleon III's ambition in this
direction was twofold. He desired to make the French Empire not only the
most advanced and strongest state in Europe, but also to have it count
as the strongest influence in world politics. In regard to the first
part of his ambitious plan, both the emperor and his various governments
were quite successful. For during the twenty-odd years of the existence
of the second empire, the progress of France along industrial,
commercial, and agricultural lines was, perhaps, greater than in any
other similar period in its history. In regard to the second part, it
also seemed for a time as if Napoleon's ambitions were to be realized.
It was under his reign that the French nation's interest in colonies
which had gradually disappeared or had at least been submerged by
England's immense undertakings along that line was aroused again, and a
considerable part of the present very expansive colonial possessions of
France is one of the contributions of the second empire. Furthermore in
the early part of his rule he was fairly successful, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page160" name="page160"></a>(p. 160)</span> not only
in expressing the desires of France in regard to conditions and policies
of other European countries, but also in forcing their fulfillment. It
is very doubtful if, had it not been for Napoleon III's interest and
assistance, a united Italy could have been formed. The part which he
played in the unification of Italy has already been touched upon in the
latter country's history, and we have also heard how his support of
Italian ambitions for unity brought France into conflict with
Austria-Hungary. It was, therefore, quite natural that when the French
Government was approached in 1865 by Prussia in regard to the proposed
Prusso-Italian treaty he should be found a supporter, even if an
inactive and silent one, of this new arrangement. And it was equally
natural that during the short war of 1866 between Austria and Prussia he
kept aloof from any actual interference. It might even have been
possible that France indirectly would have been found at that time on
the side of Prussia, for there can be no doubt that Napoleon III would
have liked to assist at that time Italy against Austria. But the Mexican
War, which he had started in 1862 and which had been going against
France during 1865 and 1866, prevented any active French interference in
European affairs at that moment.</p>

<p>Satisfactory as it was to Napoleon III and France to see Austria forced
to relinquish its Italian provinces to Italy, it was almost as
unsatisfactory, or perhaps even more so, to notice at the same time the
immense and unexpectedly rapid increase of Prussian power and influence.
Immediately after the war of 1866 Napoleon III took a number of steps
with the object of counteracting Prussia's new power or, if possible, of
destroying it. As we have already seen during the consideration of
German history of that period, he met with a fair degree of success. It
looked very much, immediately after the Prusso-Austrian War of 1866, as
if Prussia could not count then or for some time to come on the support
of the south German states in any enterprise in which Prussian influence
would be predominant. The attitude of these south German states toward
Prussia at that time was of such a nature that the French Government
could hardly be blamed in thinking that in a possible conflict between
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page161" name="page161"></a>(p. 161)</span> France and Prussia they might be found on the side of France,
or at least could be counted upon not to be on the side of Prussia.</p>

<p>This conflict, it was clear, was to come soon. For under the able
leadership of the Prussian Prime Minister, Bismarck, Prussia was
gradually more and more increasing in power and influence and intruding
on the French leadership in European affairs. That it came as early as
1870 was partly due to the French expectations of support on the part of
the south German states which we have just mentioned, and partly to the
general unrest which made itself felt in France as a result of the lack
of success of the recent foreign policy of Napoleon III.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to recite here the immediate causes as well as the
details of the result of this war, all of which have been considered in
the history of Germany of this period, and we shall, therefore, content
ourselves with the repetition of the fact that the south German states
disappointed French expectations by not only refusing to support France,
but by openly and actively supporting Prussia, because the immediate
cause of the Franco-Prussian War was considered by them a matter of
national importance affecting all German-speaking people alike. The fall
of Sedan, resulting in the capture of Napoleon III himself, brought the
downfall of the second empire and the end of the monarchistic form of
government in France.</p>

<p>The next few years are among the darkest in French history. In February,
1871, M. Thiers had been made the executive head of France, and it
became his task to conclude the peace with Germany which was ratified by
the French Assembly on May 18, 1871. Previous to that, on March 18,
1871, insurrection had broken out in Paris, and a separate government
had been set up by the people known as the Commune. This revolution was
put down only after the hardest kind of fighting between the forces of
the Commune and the Government troops, and after more than $150,000,000
worth of property in Paris had been destroyed.</p>

<p>On May 31, 1871, however, Thiers was finally elected president for a
term of three years. Considering the many and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page162" name="page162"></a>(p. 162)</span> difficult
problems which the new Government had to solve, it is rather surprising
that it lasted as long as it did, even if its end came before the
appointed time. For in May, 1873, both the president and his ministry
resigned, and General MacMahon was elected president by the Assembly.
Early that fall (1873) the last parts of the German army of occupation
left France after the last installment of the war indemnity had been
paid, and in the latter part of the same year President MacMahon's term
was extended to a period of seven years.</p>

<p>The part which England had played during and immediately after the
German-French War was typical of England's cleverness in playing foreign
politics. Intimate as at that time were the Prusso-English relations,
and inactive as England remained during the war, it still managed to
impress the French nation with a strong feeling of gratefulness for the
apparently friendly attitude which England felt toward France. In a way
this is very remarkable, for after the fall of the empire, England
extended its hospitality to ex-Empress Eugenie and her young son, and
then, later, after Napoleon Ill's release from German captivity, to the
ex-emperor himself.</p>

<p>In 1876 France had sufficiently recovered from its apparently complete
breakdown of a few years ago to be able to dispose of the largest
revenue that had ever been at the disposal of any French Government, and
this fact is of interest to us chiefly because it is one of the most
definite and most significant proofs of the remarkable inherent strength
of the French country and people.</p>

<p>In spite of this quick recovery, France for the next few years played an
absolutely inactive and comparatively unimportant part in European
affairs. During the Russo-Turkish War of 1876, for instance, the
republic declared and maintained a strict neutrality. Internally, the
republic continued to have to contend with many difficulties. Again and
again strong opposition to the republican form of government showed
itself, expressed at one time by the followers of the Bonapartist party,
at another by those of the Royalist party. However, all of these
dissensions had no actual result, and in spite of them the republic
continued <span class="pagenum"><a id="page163" name="page163"></a>(p. 163)</span> to progress and to flourish to such an extent that,
only seven years after one of the most disastrous defeats that any
European nation had ever suffered, France was able, in 1878, to invite
the rest of the world to witness at Paris the most wonderful
international exposition that had ever been staged in the history of
mankind. Early in the following year President MacMahon resigned, having
been practically forced to this step by public sentiment which
disapproved of and feared his monarchistic leanings. M. Grévy was
elected as his successor. The early summer of this year (1879) brought
death to the only son of Napoleon III while he was fighting under the
English flag during the campaign against the Zulus in South Africa, and
this event practically ended all danger of a Napoleonic restoration,
because the representatives of the Napoleonic family left were neither
closely enough related to Napoleon III nor possessed the necessary
ability to accomplish a change of government.</p>

<p>The year 1880 brought the beginning of a strong anti-Catholic movement
in France. At first this movement was directed only against the Jesuits,
but it rapidly spread and in a way may be considered the forerunner of
the radical legislation along this line which was passed in recent
years. Throughout these years the life of the different ministries was
very short and in most instances measured by months rather than by
years. To go deeper into the causes for this condition is not necessary;
but one of its results undoubtedly was that France continued to refrain
from active participation in European politics because it stands to
reason that a continuous change of the head of the Department of Foreign
Affairs made it more or less difficult, if not impossible, for France to
establish a definite foreign policy. However, in 1881 France began again
to take a more lively interest in its colonial affairs. It was in that
year that Tunis gave up its resistance to French occupation and from
that time on dates the preponderating influence which France has held
ever since in north Africa. For our purposes it is important only to
remember the fact of this preponderancy, although it may be difficult to
understand why this condition should exist, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page164" name="page164"></a>(p. 164)</span> for neither then
nor during the years to come has France shown any particular
adaptability to colonial problems nor was it able to register in its
colonies successes such as England and Germany had to show. The colonial
expansion of France, however, continued. In 1882 new territory was
acquired in Annam and, in 1884, Cambodia. This aggrandizement of France
at the cost of China finally resulted in a declaration of war on the
part of the latter country against France in August, 1884, lasting until
June, 1885, and resulting in the confirmation of the French possessions
in the Far East, not, however, until the French troops had suffered
severe reverses. In 1885 a protectorate was established over Madagascar.</p>

<p>The beginning and continuation of French expansion in other parts of the
world necessarily brought France into closer and more frequent contact
with other countries. French statesmen soon began to see the necessity
of making friends amongst the other nations if they hoped to lead France
back into the position amongst the great powers which it had a right to
occupy on account of its history as well as its extent and ability.
Throughout the first twenty years after the Franco-Prussian War, France
may be considered to have been on friendly terms with practically all
European nations with the possible exception of Germany; but these
friendships during that period had not yet ripened into intimacy nor had
they even resulted in the establishment of definite alliances with any
one of the nations. The feeling against Germany, which was, of course,
based on the defeat which France had suffered at the hands of its
eastern neighbor, was not particularly pronounced during this period
and, unless French interests would finally have resulted in the
conclusion of alliances with countries which brought it into commercial
and political conflict with Germany, there seemed to be no good reason
in the late nineties why France and Germany could not have found a
common basis of understanding. In spite of this fact it is true that
French statesmen and especially French politicians had never entirely
given up the idea of revenging the defeat of 1870, even though in a
great many instances the desire for revenge was secondary only, whereas
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page165" name="page165"></a>(p. 165)</span> the desire for the reconquest of lost territory was the chief
driving power. However, as we have said, in 1889 French relations with
the world were pleasant enough to make it possible for the republic to
again extend an invitation to all civilized nations to come to Paris for
another exhibition which was opened in May of that year, 1889. In the
same year a bill was passed making army service universal. In 1890
representatives of the various nations again met at Paris at an
international commercial conference. In 1891 the first definite signs of
an increasing intimacy with some of the European countries showed
themselves. In March, 1891, England and France agreed to arbitrate the
Newfoundland fisheries question which had been a long standing cause of
difficulties and diplomatic dissensions between the two countries. Some
time later in July and August, 1891, a large French fleet paid an
official visit to Kronstadt, the port of Petrograd, and was received
there with the most remarkable expressions of friendship and good will.
This latter event was the beginning of the Franco-Russian alliance. It
was followed in October, 1893, by a visit of a Russian fleet to Toulon,
which was greeted with similar enthusiasm.</p>

<p>In 1894 the so-called Dreyfus affair was responsible for a revival of
the anti-German feeling, because Dreyfus, who was then a captain in the
French army, had been accused and found guilty of selling military
secrets to a foreign power which was by everybody considered to have
been Germany. However, beyond intensifying the anti-German sentiment
nothing resulted, and in May, 1895, France found it possible to join
Germany and Russia in demanding from Japan the return of the Liao-Tung
peninsula to China.</p>

<p>The popular sentiment in France during the South African War was
strongly pro-Boer, although the official attitude was one of neutrality.
In September, 1896, France arrived at an understanding with Italy
concerning the former's desires for political supremacy in Tunis. The
next month brought a visit from the newly crowned Czar Nicholas who was
received in France with great hospitality. The visit was reciprocated in
August, 1897, by President Faure and Europe made up its mind <span class="pagenum"><a id="page166" name="page166"></a>(p. 166)</span>
then that France and Russia had become allied. In the next month
England, too, as Italy had done before, made arrangements to acknowledge
French supremacy in Tunis.</p>

<p>In September, 1898, however, it looked for a short time as if England
and France were to go to war with each other on account of further
French advances in north Africa. In that month Major Marchand with
French troops occupied Fashoda, a town located on the upper Nile in
territory which England claimed to belong to its own sphere of interest.
Lord, then still Sir Herbert, Kitchener, who was Governor General of the
Sudan, demanded the withdrawal of the French troops which demand was
refused; but a few months afterward the matter was amicably adjusted and
the French withdrew from Fashoda. At that time, however, the popular
French feeling certainly was not strongly pro-English; for when Major
Marchand returned to France in May, 1899, he was received with the most
effusive enthusiasm.</p>

<p>In February, 1899, President Faure died very suddenly and M. Loubet was
elected as his successor. Throughout that year the Dreyfus scandal
continued to occupy public opinion in France to the exclusion of almost
everything else. A second trial was ordered, but, although Captain
Dreyfus was again condemned to ten years' imprisonment, the president
pardoned him and in the following year, 1900, the Senate passed a bill
as a result of which further criminal prosecutions on account of the
Dreyfus affair became impossible.</p>

<p>Additional legislation regulating religious orders was passed in the
early part of 1901. In April of the same year, 1901, Toulon enjoyed the
visit of an Italian fleet which led to considerable discussion among
diplomats in regard to the apparently increasing friendship between
France and Italy. In August, 1901, the French Government recalled its
representative at Constantinople and handed his passports to the Turkish
ambassador at Paris because Turkey refused to pay damages which had been
adjudged due to some French companies. Although in November, 1901, a
French fleet occupied parts of the island of Mitylene and war clouds
once more seemed to be gathering, the matter was <span class="pagenum"><a id="page167" name="page167"></a>(p. 167)</span> finally
settled amicably by the prompt payment of the damages on the part of
Turkey. In September, 1901, the czar repeated his visit to France, where
he witnessed both naval and military maneuvers and was again received
with expressions of the most enthusiastic friendship.</p>

<p>Another change of ministry took place in 1902 when M. Waldeck-Rousseau
was succeeded by M. Combes. The new ministry caused great excitement by
closing by force all religious schools that were not conforming by this
time with the new Law of Associations. Another difficulty which the
cabinet had to face was caused by a speech of the minister of marine
during which he made remarks which were considered offensive by England
and Germany. The Government, however, disavowed this speech and declared
the expressions used to be of a private and not of an official nature.
The enforcement of the Law of Associations continued to cause serious
difficulties in the next year, 1903. Throughout the country the clergy,
which of course resented the new regulations, took a more active
interest in politics than ever before and thereby caused many serious
dissensions between its members and the Government. A very strong demand
for absolute separation of church and state began to crystallize which
found its final result in May, 1904, in the passage by the chamber of a
bill prohibiting all instructions in religious institutions by the end
of a period of five years. The attitude of the French Government toward
the Catholic Church, of course, was deeply disapproved by the pope, and
when President Loubet paid a visit to the King of Italy at Rome in May,
1904, and thereby aroused the pope to an official protest, the French
Government promptly withdrew its representative at the Vatican.</p>

<p>May, 1903, brought to Paris King Edward of England on one of his many
visits to the French capital. This time, however, he appeared there in
his official capacity and was received with general enthusiasm and
expressions of the most sincere friendship on the part of the French
nation toward the English people. Throughout 1904 the difficulties
between the French Government and the church continued with increasing
violence and in <span class="pagenum"><a id="page168" name="page168"></a>(p. 168)</span> November of that year, a bill finally was
introduced separating absolutely church and state.</p>

<p>Relations between France and Germany became considerably strained during
1905. France resented the advances which German diplomacy and German
commercial institutions had succeeded in making at Constantinople and
this resentment found its expression in a refusal to finance any more
Turkish loans. As an official explanation of this attitude it was stated
that the French Government objected to supplying funds to the Turkish
Government as long as the Turkish Government continued to spend a large
part of these funds for army and munition purchases from German firms.
More serious than this, however, was Germany's official announcement
that the empire would insist firmly on an open-door policy in Morocco.
But fortunately for the peace of Europe this question at that time was
settled by a series of conferences which were concluded in the fall of
1905.</p>

<p>In July, 1905, the French Chamber of Deputies and in September of the
same year the French Senate finally adopted a bill for the separation of
state and church.</p>

<p>In January, 1906, France again severed diplomatic relations with another
power on account of commercial disputes, this time with Venezuela.</p>

<p>In March, 1906, King Edward paid his first visit to the new President,
M. Fallières, who had been elected to succeed M. Loubet. Other
expressions of the growing intimacy between the English and French
nations were the visit of the lord mayor of London at Paris, a visit of
representatives of French universities at London, and a special
invitation extended to General French and other English officers to view
the fall maneuvers of the French army. Internally the enforcement of the
new Church and State Separation Law caused many difficulties and widened
the break between France and the pope. A general strike of miners
followed the worst mining disaster of the age, which killed over 1,200
miners at Courrières. Captain Dreyfus was finally completely vindicated.
Two changes of ministry occurred. M. Rouvier was succeeded as prime
minister by M. Sarrien, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page169" name="page169"></a>(p. 169)</span> whose resignation, on account of ill
health, brought M. Clemenceau to the helm.</p>

<p>The separation of church and state continued to hold the center of the
stage in 1907. Monsignor Montagnini, auditor of the Papal Nunciature,
was expelled. The Catholic bishops, though, of course, supporting the
pope in his objection to the separation law, finally reached a partial
understanding with the Government in regard to the continuation of
public worship in Catholic churches. Labor troubles and serious riots in
the principal wine districts occurred throughout May and June, but,
though they were embarrassing the Government, they did not result in any
changes in its composition. France exchanged notes with both Spain and
England, establishing the continuation of the <i>status quo</i> in parts of
the Mediterranean and Atlantic as far as they affected lines of
communication between the contracting powers. A Franco-Japanese
agreement of June, 1907, was principally commercial in nature, although
it expressed the adherence of the two countries to an open-door policy
in China. King Edward and Queen Alexandria again visited Paris.</p>

<p>President Fallières, accompanied by M. Pichon, the Foreign Minister,
reciprocated with a visit to England in May, 1908, where he was most
cordially received. In July, 1908, the president also paid visits to the
kings of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, and to the czar. Considerable bad
feeling was created between France and Germany on account of the action
of the German consul at Casablanca in giving shelter to some men of
German origin who had deserted from the Foreign Legion. The matter,
however, was finally referred for adjustment to the Hague Tribunal.</p>

<p>Both King Edward and the czar were visitors in France during 1909. The
French, Italian, and Spanish fleets passed in review before President
Fallières at Nice in March, 1909. A general strike, though of short
duration only, was indicative of the general feeling of unrest which
pervaded the country. The Clemenceau Ministry fell under an assault from
the ex-Minister of Foreign Affairs, Delcassé, and was succeeded by one
headed by M. Briand. In February, 1909, a new agreement was signed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page170" name="page170"></a>(p. 170)</span> between France and Germany, embodying the general principles
of French political preponderance and German commercial equality in
Morocco. This year 1910 again brought signs of the general social unrest
in the form of various strikes, the most important of which was that of
the employees of the Nord Railway. This threatened to assume dangerous
proportions, but was suppressed by M. Briand's prompt action by issuing
a mobilization order to the strikers, and thereby, having turned them
into reservists, made them subject to military law.</p>

<p>M. Briand resigned in February, 1911, and was succeeded by M. Monis and
a Radical Cabinet, which, however, included M. Delcassé as Minister of
Marine. New wine riots taxed the ingenuity of the new cabinet to its
utmost before order was restored. In June, 1911, M. Monis, who had been
seriously injured in an aeroplane accident which killed Minister of War
Berteaux, resigned on account of ill health and was followed by M.
Caillaux, Minister of Finance in the Monis Cabinet. In the late fall,
1911, the German-French difficulties about Morocco were finally settled
by another treaty reiterating the general principles of the 1909 treaty,
but arranging also for an exchange of territory between France and
Germany in the Congo, by which Germany gained some 100,000 square miles
to the east and south of its Cameroons colony.</p>

<p>Although this adjustment was not considered as particularly advantageous
to Germany in that country itself, it aroused even more criticism in
France, and resulted, in January, 1912, in the downfall of the Caillaux
Cabinet. The president called upon M. Poincaré to form a new cabinet. In
the meantime an understanding concerning Morocco had also been reached
with Spain, and a treaty between the two countries was signed. It is
significant that during the conferences held at Madrid between the
Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs and the French Ambassador, the
English Ambassador was present at the invitation of both France and
Spain. In March, 1912, a French protectorate was established by treaty.
Hardly had this been accomplished when the natives revolted, and it was
not until the fall of 1912 that <span class="pagenum"><a id="page171" name="page171"></a>(p. 171)</span> French troops succeeded in
reestablishing order. In August 1912, M. Poincaré visited Russia, and in
September Grand Duke Nicholas of Russia attended the French maneuvers,
both signs that the French-Russian friendship was losing nothing in
strength.</p>

<p>January, 1913, brought once more the presidential election, from which,
after two or three ballots, M. Poincaré emerged as M. Fallières's
successor. He asked M. Briand to form the cabinet and appointed M.
Delcassé Ambassador at Petrograd. The Briand Ministry resigned as the
result of difficulties over a matter of internal policy in March, 1913,
and was succeeded by one headed by M. Barthou. The new president paid an
official visit to the English court in June, 1913, and to the Spanish
court in October, 1913. In August, 1913, a three years' service bill was
passed to counteract recent legislative measures in Germany, increasing
the army's peace strength. This bill at first encountered considerable
opposition, especially on the part of the Socialists.</p>

<p>Like all the other great European powers, France maintained a strict
neutrality during the two Balkan wars of 1912 and 1913, and, of course,
played an important part in the various unsuccessful attempts of the
powers to prevent their outbreak, as well as in the conferences leading
up to the final adjustment. In the latter the French representatives
worked in conjunction with those of the republic's allies, England and
Russia.</p>

<p>The year 1914 brought more than the usual number of ministerial changes.
First the Barthou Cabinet fell as a result of financial legislation and
of an attack on the part of M. Caillaux. M. Doumerge, a political
associate of the latter, formed a new one with M. Caillaux in charge of
the Finance Ministry. On March 16, 1914, his wife killed M. Calmette,
the editor of the Paris "Figaro," in which he had attacked M. Caillaux
most violently and consistently. The Minister of Finance resigned on the
evening of the murder, and the rest of the cabinet followed on June 1,
1914. The new cabinet, under M. Ribot, a moderate Republican, lasted one
day and was succeeded by another, headed by M. Viviani. In July, 1914,
the president paid a visit to Russia, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page172" name="page172"></a>(p. 172)</span> from where he returned
barely in time to be greeted by Germany's declaration of war. At last
the moment had come when it would be seen what fruit the tree of the
Russian-English-French Entente was to bear.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>




<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="title">ENGLAND</p>


<p>In two respects England, or, more correctly speaking, the United Kingdom
of England and Ireland, occupies a peculiar position among the great
European nations. In the first place, it differs from all the other
European countries in that it is an island. This fact, of course, makes
a great many of its political and economic problems altogether different
from those which the other countries have to face. Its defenses, both
military and naval, are naturally greatly influenced by its geographical
location, and so are the policies which England has followed in
connection with foreign politics. Nature, having put vast oceans between
it and the rest of the world, gave thereby to England the strongest
possible natural defenses. On the other hand, this gift of Nature
necessitated that the island's government should at all times maintain a
navy, strong and efficient enough to defend it, not only from the attack
of any one other nation, but from the attack of any possible combination
of countries. Inhabited as it is by almost half a hundred million
people, crowded into a space of only 120,000 square miles, its economic
problems also are strongly influenced by its geographical location. For
it stands to reason that on comparatively so small a space it is
impossible to raise sufficient food for the inhabitants, and it also
stands to reason that many of the raw materials which in modern times
are required by civilized nations have to be secured from outside
sources. This is a second reason why an immensely strong and efficient
navy has been indispensable to England at all times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page173" name="page173"></a>(p. 173)</span> A second peculiarity of England is found in the fact that,
although England itself&mdash;by this we mean the United Kingdom of England,
Scotland, Ireland&mdash;is exceeded in extent by every one of the other
important European nations except Italy, it possesses more numerous,
more scattered, and more profitable colonies than any of the other
countries. Just as it was said of the old Spanish colonial empire at the
time of Charles V that the sun never set on it, this claim can now be
made for the English colonies. Large parts of every one of the three
continents&mdash;Africa, Asia, America&mdash;are ruled either directly or
indirectly by England, and the fourth continent, Australia, it possesses
entirely. This added only another reason to England's need of a navy.
For unless the home country's lines of communication with its colonies
in all parts of the world were kept open at all times, the latter would
have lost a great deal of their value. In a way it may be claimed that
English foreign politics was predicated by these three fundamental
conditions: to defend the home country against all comers; to insure a
plentiful supply of all raw materials and products needed by the home
country at all times; to keep open communication with its colonies in
every part of the world against any interference, and to protect these
colonial possessions against all attacks.</p>

<p>Needless to say, the fact that England possessed colonies in all parts
of the world made it at once the greatest, richest, most influential,
and most jealous nation. For one of the chief national characteristics
of the English race is its tenacity, and it is loath to let go of
anything that has once come into its possession. This characteristic
frequently brought it into conflict with other nations who wanted some
of England's possessions. Furthermore, there were many other instances
where other nations were desirous of acquiring territory or, at least,
certain rights in other countries, the acquisition of which found
England's disapproval and opposition, not because England possessed
these lands or wished to possess them, but because English interests
apparently did not make it desirable that the nation which was trying to
gain these lands should succeed. If we, however, consider that a great
many of England's colonial possessions were wrested at <span class="pagenum"><a id="page174" name="page174"></a>(p. 174)</span> one
time or another from other nations, and that in some other cases their
acquisition by conquest or treaty ran counter against the interests of
some other nations which, however, were not strong or subtle enough to
prevent England from carrying out its plans, it becomes clear why
England up to comparatively recent times may be said to have possessed
more and more bitter enemies than any other nation.</p>

<p>In the consideration of the historical development of the various
European nations which we have set forth so far we have seen that,
whenever a nation possessed or acquired colonies, it was brought
immediately into contact, sometimes friendly and more frequently
unfriendly, with other nations, and this, of course, is not only equally
true of England, but even more so, because its colonial interests were
so much more extensive than any others. In one other important direction
England exerted an immense influence on the rest of the world. From this
vast colonial empire there had been flowing for generations a steady
stream of unequaled riches into the coffers of England. And much of the
surplus wealth accumulated in this way was invested by Englishmen in
other countries, and, even though there were quite a number of countries
on the government of which England possessed no direct influence, still
there were very few nations who were not financially entirely, or at
least partly, dependent on England. The vastness of English interests
may readily be understood if we remember that out of the total inhabited
surface of the earth of about 50,000,000 square miles with 1,750,000,000
inhabitants, 13,500,000 square miles with 500,000,000 inhabitants are
under the rule of England.</p>

<p>Comparatively little of this empire was acquired by England during the
last half century, but the acquisitions which were made in that period
were at once greater and more desirable than similar acquisitions by
other nations. With very few exceptions England's new territorial
conquests during the last fifty years were made at the expense of
uncivilized and unorganized nations, and there was, therefore,
comparatively little direct cause for animosity. But, on the other hand,
a great many of the choice morsels which England gathered in were
desired <span class="pagenum"><a id="page175" name="page175"></a>(p. 175)</span> by some other nation or nations, and England's
successes, therefore, gave plenty of indirect causes for animosity,
especially if it is borne in mind that English statesmen were not only
at all times striving very hard to secure for their country the best of
everything, but were also working equally hard to prevent, if at all
possible, other nations from getting anything.</p>

<p>In the period of European history, to which we are restricting our
attention, the first milestone of the long line of conflicts between the
different nations and countries has been the war between Prussia and
Austria on one hand and Denmark on the other for the possession of
Schleswig-Holstein. In this matter England, previous to the outbreak of
actual hostilities, expressed very strongly that anyone who would attack
Denmark would have to reckon with other than Denmark; but when the
English Foreign Secretary of that period, Lord John Russell, found that
he could not get the active support of Napoleon III in opposing Prussia
and Austria's aggressive steps, Lord Palmerston's Cabinet, of which Lord
Russell was a member, found it necessary to maintain neutrality during
the war, especially in view of the fact that Queen Victoria was strongly
opposed to any active interference on the part of England. In spite of
this attitude of the queen a marriage was arranged in 1863 between the
Prince of Wales, later King Edward VII, and the daughter of King
Christian IX of Denmark, Princess Alexandria. Although it is true that
the personal relations of the ruling houses of the different European
countries did not any longer possess the same importance that they
formerly had, this new alliance undoubtedly had, even if not
immediately, an important influence on English foreign politics. For not
only was the Princess of Wales, later Queen of England, unable to forget
and forgive the territorial loss which her father had suffered at the
hands of Prussia, but this attitude was shared by her sister, who was to
become a few years later, as wife of Alexander III of Russia, a powerful
influence at the Russian court. To a certain extent, of course, the
influence of the Princess of Wales did not make itself felt until she
had become Queen of England, and possibly not very strongly then, and it
was also somewhat counteracted by the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page176" name="page176"></a>(p. 176)</span> fact that one of Queen
Victoria's daughters was married to the Crown Prince of Prussia, who
later, as Frederick III, became for a short time the German Emperor.</p>

<p>During the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 England maintained the strictest
neutrality and showed the same attitude during the few years following,
covering Napoleon III's attempts to stop the tide of Prussian
ascendancy. The English Government of that period was headed by one of
the most famous statesmen that England has ever produced, Benjamin
Disraeli. There can be no doubt that his attitude toward affairs on the
European continent was strongly influenced by Queen Victoria's own
attitude, who, it may be frankly acknowledged, was strongly pro-German
on account of her personal relations, which not only included a German
prince as son-in-law, but also a German prince as husband. The official
explanation which the prime minister gave of England's policy of
noninterference at that time was that England had "outgrown the European
continent because she was no longer a mere European power. England is
the metropolis of a great maritime empire extending to the boundaries of
the furthest oceans ... she is as ready, and as willing even, to
interfere as in the old days when the necessity of her position required
it. There is no power, indeed, which interferes more than England; she
interferes in Asia because she is really more of an Asiatic than of a
European power." This undoubtedly was not an explanation made for
convenience' sake, but expressed truly and sincerely the broad view
which the English Prime Minister took of England's mission, and later
events showed that he adhered to this new gospel of English imperialism
which was preached then for the first time. One result of French
jealousy of Prussian success was Napoleon III's effort to gain some
territorial compensations. In this connection he even went so far as to
propose secretly to Bismarck that Prussia should allow France to invade
and annex the kingdom of Belgium provided France would recognize without
opposition the new North German Confederation. Bismarck refused, and, as
a counterstroke, Napoleon III protested against the continuation of
Luxemburg's occupation by German troops. A conference of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page177" name="page177"></a>(p. 177)</span> the
powers was finally called at London in May, 1868, and a treaty was
arranged according to which the fortifications of the city of Luxemburg
were dismantled and the entire duchy received a joint guarantee of
continuous neutrality.</p>

<p>In the meantime, in 1867, Parliament had passed a bill embodying the
confederation of the various British provinces in North America and
creating a form of self-government under which the Dominion of Canada
had existed and flourished since then. Other internal measures of grave
importance occupied the attention of the English nation at that time.
Certain ritualistic tendencies in the Anglican Church aroused great
excitement and apprehension. Disraeli's Prime Ministership, which he had
assumed in February, 1867, after Lord Derby's resignation, came to an
end in December, 1868, through a victory of the Liberal party at the
general election, and Gladstone formed his first ministry. Difficulties
in Ireland culminated in a revival of Fenian activities and in the
committing of numerous outrages. With the fate of the reform and other
measures of Gladstone's government we are not concerned, for they were
almost exclusively of an internal nature. Of England's neutral attitude
during the Franco-Prussian War we have already heard; but it is worth
mentioning that previous to the outbreak of the war England attempted,
even if unsuccessfully, to mediate between France and Prussia. In spite
of the official neutrality observed by England during this war, public
sentiment was pro-French, and France undoubtedly received considerable
legitimate commercial assistance from England. This claim is well borne
out by the fact that a short time after the war, as we have already
learned during the consideration of French history, the French
Parliament passed a resolution expressing the thanks of the French
nation to England for its expressions of friendship during the recent
war. In Germany this attitude of the English public was well known and
caused a considerable amount of ill feeling. It was at that time that
Bismarck published Napoleon III's suggestion of 1867 in regard to the
invasion and annexation of Belgium, and its publication at this
particular moment had two results: it made English intervention in favor
of France absolutely impossible <span class="pagenum"><a id="page178" name="page178"></a>(p. 178)</span> and it caused the English
Government to demand from both belligerents&mdash;France and Germany&mdash;their
signatures to a treaty guaranteeing the neutrality of Belgium and
arranging that in case either France or Prussia would violate this
neutrality Great Britain would intervene in conjunction with the other
for the defense of Belgium. This treaty was also extended to include
Luxemburg. Another indirect result of the Franco-Prussian War, Russia's
declaration in October, 1870, that it considered itself no longer bound
to the terms of the treaty of Paris, 1856, in regard to the neutrality
of the Black Sea, aroused vigorous English protests. For a time it
seemed as if public opinion would force England to go to war against
Russia, but a conference of the powers who had signed the 1856 treaty
was finally called at London in December, 1870, the results of which we
have already learned. In December, 1870, the difficulties between
England and the United States, which had held over until then from the
Civil War, were satisfactorily settled by international commissioners at
Geneva. A revolution of French-Canadians broke out in 1872, but was
quickly put down. Cape Colony added to its territory in 1871 by
annexing, over the protests of the Orange Free State, territory known
then as Griqualand West. In the same year the Gold Coast was acquired on
the West Coast of Africa through a treaty with Holland, Great Britain
relinquishing in exchange its claims to Dutch Indian Sumatra. Russia's
increased activity in Asia caused considerable apprehension, which,
however, was removed by an understanding between Russia and Great
Britain, concluded in 1872, according to which Afghanistan was to be
considered not within the sphere of Russian interests in Asia.</p>

<p>In 1874 the ties of relationship which connected Queen Victoria's family
to that of the czar were strengthened by the marriage of her son, the
Duke of Edinburgh, to Grand Duchess Marie of Russia. In the same year
Czar Alexander II visited London. The Gladstone Ministry was succeeded
by one headed by Disraeli. In 1875 the Government announced the purchase
of the Suez Canal shares, then held by the Khedive of Egypt. This
practically gave England control of the canal, as the khedive's
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page179" name="page179"></a>(p. 179)</span> holdings amounted to nine-twentieths of the entire issue. A
great many of the other shares were in the hands of French investors.
But the French Government accepted England's purchase without
opposition. This move not only secured to England control of the
shortest and safest route to India, but also brought it into closer
contact with Egypt, one of the great colonial prizes of the world then
still available.</p>

<p>Disraeli soon gave proof of the sincerity of his imperialistic views. In
1876, at his suggestion and as a result of his diplomacy, the queen was
proclaimed Empress of India. In 1877 the Transvaal was annexed by
England. In the Russo-Turkish War, which broke out that year, England
maintained neutrality, but in 1878 a defensive treaty was signed between
Great Britain and Turkey which gave the island of Cyprus to England. In
1879 the Zulu War broke out and kept English forces engaged through the
greater part of the year. The following year, 1880, was marked chiefly
by riots and bloodshed in Ireland, the resignation of Disraeli, and the
return to the premiership of Gladstone, who in 1881 succeeded in passing
the Irish Land Bill. The Irish difficulties lasted throughout 1882,
1883, and 1884. Throughout that year, 1884 and 1885, English troops
fought rebellious natives in Egypt after having announced to Turkey that
it felt that it was necessary for the protection of the Suez Canal that
British troops should assume the responsibility of restoring order in
Egypt.</p>

<p>The Gladstone Ministry was defeated in 1885 and succeeded by a
Conservative Cabinet under the Marquis of Salisbury. Following the
outbreak of a war in Burma in the fall of 1885, English troops entered
the capital, and in 1886 Burma's annexation was announced. Internal
dissensions brought about two changes of cabinets in 1886, bringing in
Gladstone again, but only for four months, when Lord Salisbury returned
to the premiership. Zululand was the next addition to Great Britain's
possession, its annexation being announced in 1887. In the same year the
fiftieth anniversary of Queen Victoria's accession to the throne was
celebrated with great splendor at London, and became a means of strongly
emphasizing Disraeli's imperialistic idea. It brought <span class="pagenum"><a id="page180" name="page180"></a>(p. 180)</span> together
the most noteworthy gathering of rulers of nations, and led undoubtedly
to an exchange of views which, at least for a short time, had a
beneficial influence on the world's peace. In 1889 the British South
African Company was chartered and the foundation was laid thereby for
the immense expansion of England in South Africa. In 1890 Germany and
England adjusted various difficulties in regard to their respective
spheres of influence in Africa by signing a treaty. This gave to England
a protectorate over Zanzibar, in exchange for which it ceded the island
of Helgoland to Germany. Though this adjustment was not popular in
either country, and especially not in Germany, it led to a betterment of
conditions between England and Germany, as it removed at least one
source of continual dissension by adjusting the African question. The
young German Emperor accompanied by the Empress, paid a visit to his
grandmother, Queen Victoria, in 1891, and thereby emphasized the
cordiality of relations existing between the two Governments. In the
summer of 1892 the Salisbury Ministry resigned as the result of renewed
difficulties in Ireland, and was again succeeded by a Gladstone Cabinet.</p>

<p>In 1893 relations between France and England became temporarily strained
on account of English aggressiveness in Egypt, where France had been
considerably interested previous to England's purchase of the Suez
Canal. In 1894 the Gladstone Ministry resigned once more and was
succeeded by one headed by Lord Rosebery. Labor difficulties were
characteristic of that year, 1894, as well as the preceding one, 1893.
Another acquisition was made in 1894 by the establishment of a
protectorate over Uganda in East Africa. The appearance in 1895 of a
British fleet in Nicaragua to enforce the payment of certain indemnities
held possibilities of a conflict with the United States on account of
the Monroe Doctrine, but the matter was quickly settled and the fleet
withdrawn. The Rosebery Cabinet was succeeded by one headed by Lord
Salisbury in July, 1895, in which month a protectorate was established
over British East Africa, and in November Bechuanaland was annexed to
Cape Colony. In December, 1895, the memorable raid of Dr. Jamieson on
the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page181" name="page181"></a>(p. 181)</span> Transvaal miscarried. An ultimatum presented to Venezuela
caused strained relations between the United States and England, which,
however, were adjusted amicably by the end of 1896. Throughout 1897 and
1898 English troops were busily occupied with the pacification of newly
acquired territory in Africa, especially in Egypt and the Sudan. Toward
the end of 1898 the Fashoda incident, of which we have spoken at greater
length under the French history, brought England and France dangerously
near to war.</p>

<p>We have seen now how England, without stirring up a great deal of dust,
had been adding continually to her possessions, especially in Africa.
This, of course, aroused gradually the attention and, to a certain
extent, the jealousy of other countries. By 1899 it had become necessary
to adjust some of these difficulties, and England succeeded in doing
this by treaties with France and Egypt, as she had done before with
Germany. Her aggressive policy in South Africa, however, met determined
opposition at the hands of the Boers, who had begun to fear for their
own independence which, being of Dutch extraction, they valued greater
than life. Conferences between Lord Milner on behalf of England and
President Krueger of the Transvaal came to naught. On October 9, 1899,
the latter country presented an ultimatum which England did not answer.
Then the Boer War broke out. For our purposes it is not necessary to
consider its details. It suffices to state that it lasted until April,
1902. For almost three years the brave Boers fought against almost
impossible odds. Again and again they defeated the English, but finally
they succumbed to the British Empire's inexhaustible resources in men
and money, and on May 31, 1902, they were forced to accept England's
terms for surrender which cost them their independence. Indeed, as early
as September 1, 1900, the South African Republic was annexed, and on
October 25, Transvaal became an English colony. In its international
aspect the Boer War cost England temporarily the friendship of many
nations, who resented the ruthlessness with which they carried on war,
and ridiculed the lack of efficiency which was so noticeable during the
early stages of the war. Relations with Germany <span class="pagenum"><a id="page182" name="page182"></a>(p. 182)</span> became
especially strained as a result of the strong pro-Boer sentiment which
was evident throughout the German Empire, and which found even official
expression in a much-discussed telegram of the German Emperor to
President Krueger.</p>

<p>Although the Boer War cost England much in lives, money, and prestige,
its gain far overshadowed its cost. By it Great Britain won the richest
gold-producing mines and the most wonderful diamond mines in the world.
It consolidated its South African possessions, and, though hard pushed
at times, she emerged from it richer and more powerful than ever. Even
if this war occupied public attention almost to the exclusion of
everything else, a few noteworthy events happened during it. In 1900 the
bill providing for the federation of the Australian colonies under the
name of the Commonwealth of Australia was approved by the crown, and
completed the consolidation of another important part of the British
Empire. In January, 1901, Queen Victoria died, after a reign of
sixty-four years, and was succeeded by the Prince of Wales as Edward
VII.</p>

<p>While the preparations for the coronation of Edward VII were in progress
the king suddenly was taken seriously ill and an operation had to be
made to save his life. His coronation finally took place in Westminster
Abbey in August, 1902. The rulers of all the important countries of the
world attended either personally or were represented by important
members of their families, and it may well be said that no other event
of modern times had brought together such an assembly of the great of
the earth. Once more England seemed to have assumed a leading part in
the affairs of the world, and the nations of it apparently were not only
willing but anxious to acknowledge British power and greatness. Just
previous to the coronation, in July, 1902, Lord Salisbury had resigned
the premiership and had been succeeded by his nephew, A. J. Balfour.
Another feature of the coronation was the enthusiastic loyalty which all
the British colonies showed for the new king and the mother country.
This found even more definite expression in a series of conferences
which were held in November of the same year, 1902, between the prime
ministers of the different colonies and the British Secretary <span class="pagenum"><a id="page183" name="page183"></a>(p. 183)</span>
of the Colonies. These resulted in resolutions expressing a desire for a
closer union of the various parts of the empire and for an arrangement
by which the trade with the colonies should receive preferential
treatment. In December, 1902, Great Britain and Germany presented a
joint ultimatum to Venezuela concerning the payment of debts, and
established a joint blockade after having seized the Venezuelan fleet.
The South American republic appealed to the United States, at whose
suggestion the matter was referred to the Hague Tribunal of
International Arbitration.</p>

<p>The friendship between France and Great Britain manifested indisputable
signs of rapid growth in 1903 when President Loubet payed a three days'
visit to England in July, and was followed later that month by a
deputation of French deputies and senators. In 1903 it was also that
Joseph Chamberlain, then Secretary for the Colonies, began his campaign
against free trade and for a policy of a retaliatory tariff and
reciprocity with the colonies. Throughout 1902, 1903, and 1904 British
troops were fighting in Somaliland, where a revolution had broken out
among the natives under the leadership of the "Mad Mullah." In 1904 the
Franco-English entente became still more cordial, and in April of that
year, 1904, an agreement was signed between the two countries regulating
their relations in Newfoundland, Morocco, Egypt, West Africa, Siam, and
Madagascar, and removing thereby a prolific source of misunderstandings
and irritation. A military expedition was sent to Tibet, one of the few
important parts of Asia which had hitherto escaped from the attention of
European powers. After many difficulties and considerable fighting this
force reached the Tibetan capital, Lhassa, the ancient seat of the Dalai
Lama, who fled at the approach of the English. As a result a treaty was
signed between Tibet and England giving preferential treatment to
English trade and arranging that no other power should thereafter be
permitted to have any influence in Tibetan public affairs. In the
meantime war had broken out, in February, 1904, between Japan and Russia
over the latter's refusal to withdraw from China. In accordance with the
Anglo-Japanese treaty of 1902, Great Britain maintained neutrality
throughout this war, which, however, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page184" name="page184"></a>(p. 184)</span> was of the benevolent
kind toward Japan. English public sympathy was strongly with the latter
country. In October, 1904, the continuation of England's neutrality was
seriously threatened. After the defeat of the Russian fleet in the Far
East, the Russian Baltic fleet was ordered to go to the support of the
Russian forces. During its progress through the North Sea some shots
were fired at an English fishing fleet, killing two men and wounding
others. War between Russia and England was averted only by the prompt
disavowal of this action on the part of Russia, and an equally prompt
compensation of the Englishmen affected after the incident had been
submitted to an international commission of arbitration, which met in
Paris. It was at this time that the new <i>entente cordiale</i> between
France and England had its first test. For there is no doubt that France
exerted considerable pressure on its Russian ally in order to hasten a
prompt amicable settlement of the matter.</p>

<p>In 1905 considerable opposition developed against the increase in naval
expenditures, occasioned chiefly by the necessity of keeping step with
the accelerated pace in naval armament which Germany began to set at
that time. In July, 1905, Lord Roberts made a speech in the House of
Lords in which he called the attention of the country to the fact that
the English army was unfit for war both in members and equipment and
training. In August, 1905, the Anglo-Japanese alliance of 1902 was
modified to conform to the new conditions that had been created by the
Russo-Japanese War. The terms of this new arrangement have already been
considered fully in that section of this book which is devoted to
Japan's history. In April, 1906, an Anglo-Chinese conference modified
the Anglo-Tibetan treaty allowing China to maintain its suzerainty over
Tibet, but giving full protection to all English interests. This year,
1906, also saw the beginning of the agitation for woman suffrage, which
in the following years assumed rapidly great proportions and violence.
Other matters of internal importance&mdash;educational, religious, financial,
and other legislation&mdash;made English internal politics during this period
more virulent than at any other period in recent times, and gradually
led up to the change from a Conservative to a <span class="pagenum"><a id="page185" name="page185"></a>(p. 185)</span> Liberal
Government and to a series of very radical legislative measures.</p>

<p>One of the chief causes of recent friction between Russia and Great
Britain was removed in March, 1907, by the signing of an agreement
between the two countries regulating their respective interests in
Persia. A colonial conference, which met in London in April, 1907, gave
new impetus to the imperialistic movement and to the closer union
between the United Kingdom and the colonies. In June of that year, 1907,
the great parliamentary struggle between the two Houses of Parliament
began with the passage by the House of Commons of a bill reducing very
materially the powers of the Upper House. As a result of their
agreement, Russia and Great Britain decided in December on joint
intervention in order to prevent a threatening uprising in Persia.
Slight friction between Japan and Great Britain, which had been caused
by strong popular demonstrations in Canada against the increased
Japanese immigration, was removed by Japan's announcement of its
intention to limit extensively this immigration.</p>

<p>In April, 1908, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman resigned the premiership
and was succeeded by Mr. Asquith and a Liberal Cabinet, in which David
Lloyd-George held the position of Chancellor of the Exchequer, and soon
began to push the most radical financial and social measures which have
ever been advanced in England. In May, 1908, Great Britain, together
with France, Russia, and Italy, withdrew her troops from the island of
Crete, and in October joined France and Russia in preventing the
outbreak of war in the Balkans. After the Franco-German agreement in
regard to Morocco had been signed in February, 1909, a conference was
held between the German Chancellor, Prince von Bülow, and Sir Charles
Hardinge, with the result that the German-English relations, which had
been far from cordial for a number of years, were adjusted. The refusal
of the House of Lords to pass Lloyd-George's budget, containing
revolutionary provisions for taxation, resulted in the dissolution of
Parliament by King Edward in February, 1910. The election of the new
Parliament clearly showed that the country was in favor of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page186" name="page186"></a>(p. 186)</span>
Liberal Government, which shortly after the opening of the new
Parliament showed its disapproval of the rejection of its budget by the
House of Lords by the introduction of a Parliament Reform Bill. The
budget was passed by the Upper House in April, 1910, but not until after
the Commons had passed a resolution limiting greatly the veto power of
the House of Lords. King Edward VII died on May 6, 1910, after a short
illness and was succeeded by his son as George V.</p>

<p>Just how much King Edward's personal influence was responsible for the
shaping of his country's foreign politics during his reign it is hard to
determine. Much has been written about this question, and more
undoubtedly will be said in the years to come. The fact remains,
however, that he had a strong dislike of his nephew, the German Emperor,
and an almost equally strong aversion of German customs and ideals. On
the other hand he had long been an admirer of French culture and life,
and he was a frequent visitor in the French capital. The rapid growth of
the Franco-British friendships undoubtedly was helped along by him to
his best ability. Naturally he was influenced in this matter, not only
by personal prejudices, but chiefly by a conviction that his country's
interests were endangered by Germany's wonderful growth, and that they
could be preserved and improved more by strong alliances with other
great powers than by reaching an understanding with Germany herself.</p>

<p>The latter half of 1910 witnessed again violent parliamentary
dissensions in connection with the attempted reduction of the powers of
the House of Lords, resulting finally in another general election in
November, 1910, which gave to the Government a majority of 126. That
month also brought an announcement that English banks had signed an
agreement with German and French financial institutions to join an
American syndicate in advancing $50,000,000 to China, one of the few
instances of a joint financial undertaking by German and British
interests.</p>

<p>The greater part of 1911 was taken up with the settlement of the
difficulties between the Commons and the Lords, resulting finally in the
surrender of the latter and the adoption by them of the Commons' bill
depriving the Upper House of much of its <span class="pagenum"><a id="page187" name="page187"></a>(p. 187)</span> former power. Hardly
had this troublesome question been adjusted when the question of Home
Rule for Ireland caused new difficulties of the severest nature. So
strong was the opposition of one part of Ireland to Home Rule, and so
strong the demand of the other part for it, that the dissensions
gradually reached the point where open revolution seemed to be imminent.
In July, 1911, the Anglo-Japanese alliance was renewed for a period of
ten years. During the Franco-German dispute about Morocco, which
threatened to disrupt the peace of Europe, Great Britain's influence was
thrown on the side of France, a fact which, of course, resulted in
increased bitterness against Great Britain on the part of Germany. In
November the king and queen left England on a trip to India in order to
be crowned as Emperor and Empress of India. In common with other
countries, England experienced in 1912 a great deal of social unrest,
which found expression in strikes as well as in extremely radical
legislation. The Irish question and the agitation for woman suffrage
continued to occupy public attention in 1912. In August of that year,
1912, Great Britain joined with France and Germany in accepting
Austria-Hungary's invitation to confer on the Balkan situation, which
was rapidly assuming grave importance. In conjunction with these powers,
as well as Italy and Russia, it maintained a strict neutrality during
the Balkan Wars of 1912 and 1913, just as it had done during the
Turko-Italian War of 1911 and 1912. At England's invitation the
ambassadors of the powers met in London in December, 1912, to discuss
the Balkan question while the representatives of the Balkan States and
Turkey conferred concerning peace.</p>

<p>Almost coincident with Germany's increased efforts to upbuild its navy,
a change had been made in the incumbency of the admiralty. One of the
younger and most active members of the Liberal party, Winston Churchill,
a member of the House of Marlborough, became First Lord. He created a
sensation by a speech made in the Commons in March, 1913, suggesting
that Germany and Great Britain should agree to stop naval construction
for a period of a year. Although this proposal received a great deal of
attention, it had no tangible result, and the race <span class="pagenum"><a id="page188" name="page188"></a>(p. 188)</span> for
increased armament continued. Neither 1913 nor 1914 brought about any
diminution in the difficulties regarding the Irish question, in fact
rather the opposite, and the Government even went so far as to prohibit
the importation of arms into Ireland. Armed resistance against Home Rule
on the part of Ulster seemed to be unavoidable. Agitation in England and
Ireland over Home Rule had become so violent that the murder of the heir
to the Austro-Hungarian throne in June, 1914, did not arouse as much
interest and attention in England as it would have done otherwise.
Revolution in Ireland was a matter that England expected at that
particular moment, rather than a general European war. Not until the
British fleet, assembled at Portsmouth for maneuvers, left there on July
29, 1914, under sealed orders, was the country aroused to the
possibility of a world war, which had been considered for so many years
impossible by some and inevitable by others, and which was now about to
break out.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>



<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="title">ITALY</p>


<p>In the middle of the nineteenth century the position of Italy was
somewhat analogous to that of Germany. It consisted of a number of
separate states, and, in spite of the fact that all of these states were
inhabited by people speaking the same language and having the same
ideals and customs, they seemed to be unable to combine. One of the
results of this was the fact that the country adjoining on the north,
Austria, was meddling continually with Italian affairs and attempting to
gain a lasting influence over them. There were too many racial
differences, however, between the two countries to permit an arrangement
of this nature to continue for any length of time without causing
serious conflicts. Statesmen in the various Italian states finally
became convinced that it would be only a question of time before some
foreign nation would succeed in dominating them unless <span class="pagenum"><a id="page189" name="page189"></a>(p. 189)</span> they
would be able to consolidate and show a united front to any and all
outsiders.</p>

<p>The difficulties in the way of Italian unification were manifold. For
our purposes, however, we are not interested in them or in the means by
which they were overcome beyond the fact that they finally were
overcome, and that as early as 1859 a large number of the different
Italian states had been united with the assistance of Napoleon III under
the rule of Victor Emmanuel II, originally King of Sardinia and
Piedmont. In that year, however, after Austria had been driven out of
Lombardy through the combined efforts of Italian and French troops,
Napoleon III suddenly arrived at an understanding with Francis Joseph,
and peace was concluded between France and Austria. This left in the
hands of the Austrians still an important part of northern Italy known
as the Quadrilateral. Rome, too, and a considerable territory
surrounding it, known as the Papal State, was not included in the newly
formed kingdom of Italy, the pope refusing to give up his temporal
powers and Napoleon III supporting him in that refusal to the extent of
maintaining French troops in Rome.</p>

<p>The Austro-Prussian War of 1866, as we have already shown, had important
results for Italy. For previous to its breaking out Prussia had
concluded a treaty with Italy, and when hostilities began between
Austria and Prussia, Italy immediately attacked her old enemy. When
peace was concluded between Prussia and Austria, Prussia insisted, in
order to reward her southern ally, that Austria should relinquish
practically all of her Italian possessions. Four years later, in 1870,
the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War necessitated the withdrawal of
the French troops from Rome, and immediately after that event the forces
of King Victor Emmanuel appeared before Rome and occupied it to the
great satisfaction of the Romans, and in spite of all the protests of
the pope. The latter lost his temporal powers, although he was permitted
to retain the Vatican. This completed the unification of Italy.</p>

<p>The completion of the unification of Italy, of course, created many
difficult internal problems, chief of which was the adjustment between
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page190" name="page190"></a>(p. 190)</span> the state and the church. The latter, as represented by the
pope, refused to become reconciled to the new conditions or to
acknowledge the legality of the so-called Laws of the Guarantees,
according to which he was given all the privileges of a sovereign, the
possession of the Vatican and Lateran palaces, and a considerable annual
income. None of these appeased the church, which steadfastly refused to
recognize the existence of the Italian state. The difficulties created
thereby can readily be understood if one considers the immense influence
that the Roman Catholic Church possesses over the minds of its members,
and if one further remembers that practically all Italians are devout
Catholics.</p>

<p>For many years after the unification of Italy and the destruction of the
church's temporal power, continuous and strong efforts were made by the
latter's adherents to restore to the pope that of which, as they
claimed, he had been deprived illegally. The only way in which the
Italian Government could subdue and overcome these efforts was by
legislation which would make these efforts not only futile but also
dangerous to the pope's friends, and these repressive practices
naturally resulted in a strong undercurrent of dissatisfaction. These
conditions, as well as a great many economic problems, very difficult of
solution, kept the new kingdom sufficiently occupied to keep it out of
international politics for a considerable period of time. It was not
long, however, before Italy was bound to be drawn into the general
scramble for colonial possessions. Italy's interests in this direction
were rather restricted, but within these restrictions they were very
intense. Its geographical situation made it evident that any attempt on
the part of any foreign power to gain or increase its influence in
northern Africa would be a matter of grave concern to Italy. France had
been deeply interested for many years in north Africa, and when the
French Republic showed signs of strengthening and enlarging its
interests, immediately after it had somewhat recuperated from its defeat
by Germany in 1871, it was quite natural that Italy should look to
Germany for an alliance to counteract France's colonial policy. The
seizure of Tunis by France in 1881 undoubtedly was more <span class="pagenum"><a id="page191" name="page191"></a>(p. 191)</span>
responsible than any other single factor for Italy's decision to ally
itself as closely as possible with Germany. Inasmuch as the latter
country in the meanwhile had arrived at a very close understanding with
Austria-Hungary, there were considerable difficulties in the way of an
Italian-German arrangement. For not only was it difficult for Italy to
forget its old struggles and quarrels with Austria, but the southern
kingdom felt very keenly on the subject of the retention on the part of
Austria of territory inhabited by Italians, even though this territory
was comparatively small in extent. This attitude of Italy toward Austria
may be called typical of one nation's attitude toward another. It shows
clearly the unreasonableness of national sentiments. For even granting
that Italy had a good cause for resenting Austrian rule over
Italian-speaking people, the necessity of possessing this particular
strip of country was much greater to Austria than it was to Italy,
giving, as it did, to Austria the only seaport available, whereas Italy
stood in no need whatsoever of additional opportunities of this nature.
However, Italy finally reached the decision that, between the danger of
having to face alone the further extension of French power in north
Africa or burying the hatchet with Austria, the latter proposition was
the easier and more advantageous. As a result of this decision a treaty
was arranged finally between Germany, Austria, and Italy in 1883, and
this new alignment of three central European powers has since been known
as the Triple Alliance. We must not forget, however, that in spite of
this arrangement Italy never really has been a sincere friend or
well-wisher of Austria, and it is this fact which formed the basis for
the final disruption of the Triple Alliance and the entrance of Italy in
the war of 1914 on the side of the Triple Entente.</p>

<p>The arrangement with Austria and Germany enabled Italy to enter upon a
colonial policy in Africa in the vicinity of the Red Sea. As has been
the case of all other colonial powers, this undertaking was wrought with
a great many difficulties. It forced Italy to fight wars in distant
countries, expensive in money as well as in human life, and though, in
spite of repeated defeats, Italy's colonial enterprises have made
considerable progress, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page192" name="page192"></a>(p. 192)</span> the losses entailed up to the present
time outweigh to a considerable extent the gains.</p>

<p>In 1887 the Triple Alliance was renewed for the first time. In the
meantime Italy had continued to make considerable progress with its
colonial expansion. Another renewal of the Triple Alliance took place in
1891. In 1893 Italy passed through a period of public scandals in
connection with the failure of some of the state banks, involving one of
its most prominent and able statesmen, Premier Crispi. All these years
the Italian Government found it more and more difficult to raise the
necessary revenues to sustain its colonial policy and to provide for the
increases in army and navy which the possession of colonies naturally
required. Rioting took place in a great many parts of the kingdom, and
had to be suppressed by force. Socialism rapidly spread, and in October,
1894, the Government finally found it necessary to suppress socialistic
and similar organizations. Earlier in that year, 1894, fighting took
place between the Italian forces and dervishes in Abyssinia, which ended
in success for the Italian arms. But in December of 1895 the Italian
army in Abyssinia suffered a severe defeat at the hands of King Menelik.
The same thing happened in March of 1896, and the continued inability of
the Italian army to make headway in Abyssinia finally resulted in the
overthrow of the Government and the resignation of Premier Crispi, who
was succeeded by Rudini. The loss of Italian prestige had been so
severe, however, that Italy was forced in the fall of 1896 to conclude a
treaty at Addis-Abeba with Abyssinia, by which Italy relinquished all
its claims to a protectorate over the ancient African kingdom. The year
1898 was marked again with a series of riots, caused by the high price
of grain, and resulting in clashes between the people and the military
forces with considerable loss on both sides.</p>

<p>Another result was the fall of the new cabinet, which was succeeded by
one formed by General Pelloux, which, however, lasted less than one
year.</p>

<p>In July, 1900, King Humbert was assassinated during a visit to Monza by
an Italian anarchist who had just returned from <span class="pagenum"><a id="page194" name="page194"></a>(p. 194)</span> the United
States. The crown prince succeeded the murdered king as Victor Emmanuel
III. In 1901 a delegation of representative English Roman Catholics,
headed by the Duke of Norfolk, paid a visit to the pope, and expressed
the hope of the English Catholics for a restoration of the pope's
temporal powers, an action which caused considerable offense in Italian
Government circles.</p>

<p>Europe in 1793-1815, Historical Map.</p></div>

<p>In 1902 the Triple Alliance was renewed, in spite of rumors to the
effect that Italy was contemplating a change in its international
politics. Previous to the announcement of this renewal, it had become
known that France and Italy had arrived at an understanding in regard to
their north African interests, as well as concerning all questions
affecting the Mediterranean. This in conjunction with an announcement
made by the French Foreign Minister, M. Delcassé, to the effect that
assurances had been given to France by the Italian Government that no
part of its treaty with Germany and Austria was in any manner directed
against France or contemplating an aggressive attitude toward the
republic, made it clear that the Franco-Italian rapprochement was
progressing rapidly. The same year also brought a severance of
diplomatic relations between Italy and Switzerland, caused by a
difference of opinion between the Swiss Government and the Italian
Ambassador at Bern. However, matters were adjusted amicably later in the
year. The improvement in Franco-Russian relations apparently had a
similar result in regard to Italy's relations with Russia, for the King
of Italy paid a visit to the czar, during which&mdash;even if only
semiofficially&mdash;international politics were discussed. A little later,
however, the king also visited the German court.</p>

<p>These exchanges of visits with the rulers of other countries continued
in 1903. King Edward VII of England, as well as the German Emperor, paid
visits to Rome, both calling on the pope during their stay. The King and
Queen of Italy made an official visit at Paris and London. The internal
difficulties were somewhat less marked. In July, 1902, Pope Leo XIII
died, and was succeeded by Cardinal Sarto, Archbishop of Venice, as Pius
X.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page195" name="page195"></a>(p. 195)</span> Again, in 1904, the German Emperor visited at Naples. President
Loubet returned the king's and queen's visit to Paris in April, 1904,
and thereby caused the break between France and the pope, on account of
the latter's protest against the official recognition on the part of the
head of a Catholic nation of the state which had deprived the head of
the Catholic religion of his dominions.</p>

<p>Throughout 1905 Italy was occupied with internal affairs, the most
important of which were the resignation on account of ill health of
Prime Minister Giolitti, the formation of a new cabinet under Signor
Fortis, and the purchase of the railways by the state. The Fortis
ministry lasted only until February, 1906, when it was succeeded by one
headed by Baron Sonnino, and in May by another under Signor Giolitti.
Although Italy had supported Germany at the Algeciras conference, the
support had not been all that had been expected, and considerable
resentment at Italy's lukewarm attitude was expressed in the German
newspapers. The Government disclaimed any change in its attitude toward
the Triple Alliance, announcing, however, at the same time its intention
to maintain good relations with France and Great Britain. The latter
were confirmed by a visit of King Edward and Queen Alexandra in April,
1907.</p>

<p>Early in 1908 difficulties of a commercial nature between Turkey and
Italy led to the mobilization of the Italian fleet. Turkey, however,
thereupon acceded to all of Italy's demands. Foreign affairs were
overshadowed entirely throughout 1909 by the frightful destruction
wrought by a series of violent earthquakes which shook the Strait of
Messina on December 28, 1908, killing over 50,000 people. King Edward,
Emperor William, and Czar Nicholas again visited Italy at different
times in 1909.</p>

<p>On September 29, 1911, Italy declared war against Turkey, which latter
country had not answered satisfactorily an Italian ultimatum concerning
Tripoli. The war, which was principally fought in Africa, lasted until
October 18, 1912, when a treaty of peace was signed at Lausanne,
Switzerland, arranging for the immediate occupation of Tripoli and
Cyrenaica by Italy against an annual payment to Turkey. Throughout the
war the other <span class="pagenum"><a id="page196" name="page196"></a>(p. 196)</span> European powers had maintained strict
neutrality. A few days before peace was concluded, October 8, 1912,
Montenegro had started that war against Turkey which was destined to
grow finally into the Balkan War. Italy, in common with the other
European powers, maintained strict neutrality throughout the two Balkan
wars, and participated in the conference of London which settled the
Balkan question, at least temporarily, in May, 1913. Throughout that
year (1913) Italian troops found considerable difficulty in keeping
order among the natives of Cyrenaica, and in suppressing uprisings in
various parts of this colony.</p>

<p>The outbreak of the war found Italy still a member of the Triple
Alliance; but the southern kingdom stoutly maintained that the terms of
the alliance did not call for its active participation. The latter, at
any rate, would have been an absolute impossibility, for public opinion
was too strong against Austria-Hungary to permit ever that Italian
troops should fight side by side with Austrians. In a general way Italy
found itself in a most unfortunate position. Moral obligations
undoubtedly strongly called, at least, for its neutrality in any war in
which both its allies were involved. Political considerations equally
strongly demanded that Italy should avoid offending the
French-English-Russian combination, which could have ruined Italy in no
time by an even superficial blockade. In regard to Albania its position
was equally difficult. Its own interests there conflicted both with
Austrian and Serbian ambitions. The result was naturally&mdash;neutrality and
diplomatic shilly-shallying.</p>

<p>One of the most ardent supporters of the Triple Alliance was the Marquis
di San Giuliano, who had been minister of foreign affairs since 1905.
His death in October, 1914, undoubtedly had a great influence on Italy's
further attitude. In October, 1914, Signor Salandra's cabinet was
reconstructed. At that time the prime minister was still in more or less
sympathy with the Giolitti party, which were in favor of continuing the
Triple Alliance, at least to the extent of maintaining neutrality. The
war party, however, gained rapidly in strength, and finally brought
about a reversal of the country's foreign policy by denouncing <span class="pagenum"><a id="page197" name="page197"></a>(p. 197)</span>
the Triple Alliance of almost half a century's standing. The next step,
of course, was Italy's declaration of war against Austria in May, 1915.</p>

<p>On May 10, 1915, the German and Austrian Consuls were removed from their
respective posts. Events progressed so rapidly that by May 20, 1915, the
War Party under the ministership of Salandra was placed in power.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>




<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="title">BELGIUM</p>


<p>The geographical location of Belgium is at once its blessing and its
curse. Its possession of a valuable seacoast, its proximity to the rich
and highly developed countries of Germany, France, and England have made
it, in spite of its comparatively very small extent, one of the richest
countries. Its ships have carried the goods of many other nations, and
its ports have been the gateway of an immense international commerce.
But these very nations which in time of peace have been the source of
much of Belgium's wealth, have brought many wars upon this country.
Again and again it has been Europe's battle ground. Whenever France and
Germany have gone to war against each other it has always been a
question which one would get at the other first&mdash;through Belgium. And
then through it lies the shortest road to rich and proud Albion.</p>

<p>A change for the better seemed to have come for the little kingdom as a
result of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. At its outbreak both of the
belligerents reaffirmed the treaty of London of 1831 and 1839, by which
they as well as Great Britain, Austria, and Russia were bound to respect
Belgium's neutrality and integrity, and to Great Britain it is that
Belgium was especially indebted for this promise. For the island kingdom
made it plain to both Russia and France that it could not and would not
stand by idly if Belgium were invaded. After the end of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page198" name="page198"></a>(p. 198)</span>
war had come, Russia, France, and Great Britain signed a new agreement
by which they arranged to respect forever Belgium's neutrality, and if
one of the signatories should break the arrangement the other two were
to combine for the protection of Belgium. Although this pact has been
kept officially ever since, it seems in the light of recent discoveries
in Belgian archives as if Belgium itself had placed itself outside of it
by arriving at a secret understanding with both England and France that
both of these countries should be permitted certain privileges in case
of war with Germany. How much truth there is to these claims history
will undoubtedly discover and announce.</p>

<p>The fact remains that, secure in its guaranteed neutrality, Belgium has
prospered and grown. In spite of its smallness it has become one of the
great industrial and commercial countries in Europe. To a great extent
this was due to the remarkable gifts possessed by one of its recent
rulers, Leopold II, the uncle and predecessor of the present king,
Albert I. Leopold succeeded his father, Leopold I, in 1865. The latter
had been on very friendly terms with Queen Victoria, and, in a way,
English friendship for Belgium dates from that period, although Leopold
II was not popular at the English court. Leopold II was married to an
Austrian archduchess. His sister was the wife of the unfortunate
Maximilian who, as Emperor of Mexico, betrayed by Napoleon III in his
hour of need, was stood up against the walls of a Mexican town and shot
by his rebellious subjects. One of his daughters, Stefanie, married the
unhappy Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria-Hungary, who died mysteriously at
a hunting lodge long before his time. But Leopold II himself was of a
different mold than all his relations. He was a man of powerful
intellect, shrewd business sense, and remarkable foresight. Much against
his people's will he became first the promoter and then the king of an
immense and wonderfully valuable African empire, the Congo Free State.
This enterprise was not at all popular in Belgium. But the king had a
will of his own and saw it through, much to the final advantage of his
country. By a will made in 1889 he left the Congo State to Belgium,
which annexed it in 1908, and which has found it not an <span class="pagenum"><a id="page199" name="page199"></a>(p. 199)</span>
unprofitable investment. The Congo question&mdash;its finances, development,
and administration&mdash;is the main feature of internal politics of Belgium
in modern times. Of course there were other questions&mdash;electoral reform,
financial legislation, military expenditures&mdash;that offered plenty of
causes for political discussions and difficulties, but they were always
more or less overshadowed by the affairs of the African colony.</p>

<p>In foreign politics Belgium&mdash;on account of its neutrality&mdash;had no cause
to mix. It stood on the same footing with each of the other nations: it
expected from each and gave to each friendly consideration. It might
almost be called the irony of fate that the country which kept, due to
its special status, out of all international disturbances of the last
seventy-five years should be drawn into the Great War deeper than almost
any other country. It is quite possible that had Leopold II still been
at the helm in 1914, his country's fate might have been different.</p>

<p>His successor was his younger brother's younger son, Albert I, a man
who, though lacking, of course, his uncle's greater experience, seemed
to have inherited some of his intellectual qualities. He married a
Bavarian princess, a sister of the late Crown Princess of Bavaria, and a
niece of the late Empress Elizabeth of Austria and the ex-Queen Mother
of Portugal.</p>

<p>Belgium's populace consists of two widely different parts&mdash;Flemings and
French. The former are closely related racially to the Dutch inhabitants
of Holland, with which country Belgium formerly was united. The French
portion of the populace is very much in sympathy with French ideals and
ideas, and has suppressed the Flemish half as much as possible, a great
deal of strife resulting. Racially and socially Belgium felt itself
closely allied to France, economically its interests were much greater
with Germany. If one can speak at all of Belgium's foreign politics
previous to the outbreak of the war, one must say that they were
influenced by sentiments rather than anything else.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>





<h2 class="b1"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page200" name="page200"></a>(p. 200)</span> CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="title">JAPAN</p>


<p>The awakening of modern Japan may be said to be coincident with
Commodore Perry's mission to the Far East in 1859. His was not only the
first of a long series of foreign embassies, but it resulted in a treaty
between Japan and the United States, and aroused the curiosity of the
Japanese sufficiently to send special ambassadors of their own to the
United States, and later to other countries. This interest in western
affairs at first found considerable opposition at home on the part of
the conservative element, opposition which even resulted in civil war.
The more liberal attitude, however, carried the day. By 1879 Tokyo had
been made the capital and western laws had been introduced. At the same
time that Tokyo was made the capital the present form of imperial
government was adopted and the new emperor promised on his oath to give
to his people a constitution. This latter was proclaimed in 1889 and the
diet met for the first time in 1891.</p>

<p>Only three years later the Chino-Japanese War began. Its cause was
Chinese oppression of Korea. In one short year the ancient empire of
China was thoroughly beaten by its new rival for supremacy in the Far
East. As a result Japan received at the conclusion of peace in 1895
Formosa, a huge indemnity, and independence was granted to Korea. This
was a wonderful achievement for the young empire, and the entire world's
attention was centered on Japan. Some of the European powers interested
in China began to fear for their interests and Germany, Russia, and
France combined to restrain Japan and moderate its terms to China. This
aroused considerable ill feeling in Japan against the three powers whose
influences were said to have deprived Japan of some of the fruits of its
dearly bought victory. Especially was this feeling directed against
Russia whose interests in China clashed directly with those of Japan.
However, in 1898, these two countries concluded a treaty in <span class="pagenum"><a id="page201" name="page201"></a>(p. 201)</span>
which they both acknowledged Korea's independence and promised to
respect it.</p>

<p>As soon as commercial interests of the various foreign countries had
grown, Japan had to suffer the installment of consular courts of the
more important European nations. This soon was felt by the Japanese as
an intrusion on their sovereignty. In 1899 treaties which had been
arranged during the preceding years between Japan and these countries
abolishing the consular courts went into effect. Greater and greater
became Japan's influence in the Far East. The superiority of its armies
over the Chinese forces during the short war of 1894-1895, the
apparently wonderful adaptability of the Japanese, their equally
wonderfully rapid progress along commercial and scientific lines soon
made Japan a desirable ally.</p>

<p>As many times before in history Great Britain's statesmen showed greater
foresight than those of other countries. In 1902 they arranged an
alliance between their country and Japan which more than offset the
Franco-Russo-German bloc of 1895. It was signed at London in August,
1905, by Lord Lansdowne and Count Hayastu and provided for: (a) The
consolidation and maintenance of the general peace in the regions of
eastern Asia and of India; (b) The preservation of the common interests
of all powers in China by insuring the independence and integrity of the
Chinese Empire and the principle of equal opportunities for the commerce
and industry of all nations in China; (c) The maintenance of the
territorial rights of the high contracting parties in the regions of
eastern Asia and of India, and the defense of their special interests in
the said regions. If the rights and interests referred to above are in
jeopardy, the two governments will communicate with one another fully
and frankly as to the measures which should be taken to safeguard those
menaced rights or interests, and will act in common in case of
unprovoked attack or aggressive action, wherever arising, or the attack
or aggressive action, whenever arising, on the part of any other power
or powers.</p>

<p>This agreement was modified in 1911 to fit the changed conditions in
China and a new article was added which provided <span class="pagenum"><a id="page202" name="page202"></a>(p. 202)</span> that "should
either high contracting party conclude a treaty of general arbitration
with a third power, it is agreed that nothing in this agreement shall
entail upon such contracting party an obligation to go to war with the
power with whom such treaty of arbitration is in force." At the same
time it was arranged that the alliance should remain in force for ten
years and "unless denounced twelve months before the expiration of the
said ten years, it will remain binding until the expiration of one year
from the day on which either of the high contracting parties shall have
denounced it. But if, when the date fixed for its expiration arrives,
either ally is actually engaged in war, the alliance shall, <i>ipso
facto</i>, continue until peace is concluded."</p>

<p>In the meantime, however, difficulties had arisen between Russia and
Japan, over the former country's refusal to evacuate certain parts of
Manchuria, occupied as a result of the Boxer uprising in the suppression
of which Japanese troops had participated successfully with those of the
other great nations. Japan sent an ultimatum to Russia which did not
receive prompt enough attention and war was declared in 1904. For the
second time the world's attention was centered on Japan, and to the
amazement of the western world the eastern empire defeated the Russian
Colossus most severely and consistently both on land and on sea. The
financial burden of the war, however, was a severe strain on the limited
resources of the young world power and it was forced to accept mediation
proffered by the United States at a time when not all its objects had
been accomplished. Peace was concluded at Portsmouth in the United
States. Japan was very moderate in the consideration of the terms as we
have already seen during the review of the history of Russia.</p>

<p>In 1907 both France and Russia signed agreements with Japan in regard to
the independence and integrity of China and acknowledging the "open
door" policy in commercial matters for all nations alike.</p>

<p>In 1910 Korea was annexed, much against the desire of the natives who
made Japan's task a difficult one by means of many uprisings and
conspiracies. Internal affairs during the last ten <span class="pagenum"><a id="page203" name="page203"></a>(p. 203)</span> years also
have given cause for anxiety. The two great wars in rapid succession
have put a heavy financial burden on the shoulders of the great masses
and socialistic tendencies have found a fertile soil in Japan. Labor
disturbances have sometimes assumed serious proportions and so have
demonstrations against other nations who had aroused the animosity of
the Japanese people by some acts. In general, however, the progress of
the country continues.</p>

<p>Japan's attitude in the Great European War was, of course, influenced
chiefly by its alliance with Great Britain. Its general attitude toward
Germany had always been a friendly one. For as Germany has played the
successful schoolmaster along military and scientific lines for many
nations, it has also done for Japan. The efficiency of the Japanese army
is due chiefly to what Japanese officers have learned in German
regiments and military schools.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>




<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="title">THE NEUTRAL STATES&mdash;PORTUGAL AND SPAIN</p>


<p>Now that we have reviewed the historical development of all the
belligerents, it becomes necessary to pay some attention to the few
European states which so far have not yet actually become involved. For
our purposes it will not be necessary to go into any great detail
concerning the political history of these noncombatant nations. We are
only interested in those features of their political development which
have some bearing on the reasons for their present neutrality and on
their attitude toward the various nations at war. In our consideration
of the neutral states there will not be included either Greece or
Rumania, because they will be covered together with the other Balkan
nations in a separate section of this work.</p>

<p>Up to the beginning of 1916 there were two countries in southern Europe
which had managed to remain in a condition <span class="pagenum"><a id="page204" name="page204"></a>(p. 204)</span> of neutrality,
Spain and Portugal. In the month of March the latter country, however,
precipitated a declaration of war on the part of the Central European
Powers and their allies by seizing the mercantile steamers of these
various countries which at the outbreak of the war had sought refuge in
Portuguese ports and had been interned there. Before we determine why
Portugal took this step which was sure to provoke a declaration of war,
it will be necessary to consider shortly the history of this country in
modern times. It is many centuries since Portugal has lost its former
importance as a European nation which was based primarily on its
extensive colonial possessions. Its last really valuable and important
colony, however, Brazil, was not lost until the early part of the
nineteenth century, and even now Portugal possesses colonies in Asia and
Africa which are twenty times as large in extent as its European
territory. Its African possessions are adjoining chiefly British
colonies and this close proximity to parts of the British Empire has
resulted at times in some difficulties between the two countries, the
most recent and important of which occurred in 1890 and in 1894. In
spite of these slight disagreements, however, Portugal made an
arrangement, quite some time ago, according to which it was under
certain conditions to furnish limited subsidiary forces to England, in
exchange for which England promised to assume the friendly rôle of a
protector in times of need. It is undoubtedly this arrangement with
England which finally resulted in the aggressive action on the part of
Portugal of which we have just heard. Up to 1910 Portugal was a kingdom.
In that year, however, a revolution broke out chiefly on account of
oppressive financial measures which the Government had been in the habit
of passing and the reigning King, Manuel, was forced to flee the
country. Shortly afterward his former subjects exiled him and decided
for a republican form of government which in spite of various slight
monarchial revolutions has been maintained since. The 1910 revolution
was preceded by two years by the murder of King Manuel's father, Carlos
I, and his older brother, Luis. After King Manuel had been exiled,
England assumed toward <span class="pagenum"><a id="page205" name="page205"></a>(p. 205)</span> Portugal a part very similar to that
which England had assumed toward France after the fall of the second
empire. It offered a haven of refuge for the exiled king and his
relatives, but at the same time acknowledged the establishment of the
Portuguese Republic and showed in various ways that it was in sympathy
with the liberal movement in Portugal.</p>

<p>Immediately adjoining Portugal on the east is Spain, which is separated
from France on the north by the Pyrenees. Just as Portugal, Spain had
been in times past one of the great colonial powers of the world,
greater even than its neighbor. In fact, at one time in the world's
history Spain occupied very much the same position that England occupies
to-day. But this splendor belongs to the past and gradually Spain has
lost practically all of its colonies with the single exception of the
few comparatively small settlements and islands in Western Africa which,
however, still total 82,000 square miles. Its last really important and
valuable colonies in the West Indies (Cuba, Porto Rico), and the
Philippine Islands in the Far East were lost as a result of the
Spanish-American War of 1898. Some other islands in the Pacific Ocean
were sold in the year following, 1899, to Germany. In more recent times,
however, Spain has shown again more aggressiveness in connection with
the acquisition of colonial possessions which chiefly centered in that
part of north Africa which is immediately opposite the south coast of
Spain. Its activities in that territory were not appreciated by the
natives who at various times with more or less success revolted against
the foreign rule and finally brought about the Moorish War of 1909,
which was terminated by Spain only after the Spanish troops had
experienced a number of defeats and after a considerable expenditure of
money and life.</p>

<p>Wilhelm II, German Emperor and King of Prussia.</p></div>

<p>During the second half of the nineteenth century Spain went through a
comparatively large number of revolutions, dynastic changes and other
internal difficulties. In 1886 Queen Isabella, a member of the Bourbon
family, was driven out of the country by a revolution of her subjects.
The latter, however, decided in favor of a continuation of the
monarchial form of government <span class="pagenum"><a id="page206" name="page206"></a>(p. 206)</span> and thereupon set out to find
some European prince who would be willing to assume the burden of the
Spanish crown. We have already heard that this quest was one of the
principal direct causes of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, because
Napoleon III attempted to force a promise from King William of Prussia
to the effect that the latter would not permit his relative, the Prince
of Hohenzollern, to accept the crown of Spain which had been offered to
him. In 1870, however, the Spanish people succeeded in inducing Amadeus
of Italy, a relative of the ruler of the newly formed Italian kingdom,
to become King of Spain. Only two years later, in 1872, the so-called
Carlist War broke out which had its basis in the attempt of Don Carlos,
also a member of the Bourbon family, to secure the crown of Spain to
which he claimed to have prior rights to those of Queen Isabella's
branch of the family. This war, which really was a civil war, was
accompanied by a great deal of bloodshed and cruelty and finally brought
about the abdication of King Amadeus. For a short time after that Spain
became a republic, but in 1874 the people decided that their interests
would be better served by a monarchy and they made the son of Queen
Isabella, Alfonso XII, their King. The latter was married twice, first
to Princess Mercedes and after her death to Archduchess Marie Christine
of Austria. Of the former marriage the issue was one girl, Mercedes, who
at the death of Alfonso XII in 1885 became Queen of Spain with her
stepmother as regent. In 1886, however, a posthumous male heir was born
who immediately upon his birth became legally King of Spain as Alfonso
XIII. Of course Queen Christine's regency continued until Alfonso XIII
became of age. During her regency Queen Marie Christine faced an arduous
task in her attempt to maintain for her minor son the throne of his
father, but in spite of the many difficulties that she had to face she
succeeded. These difficulties were chiefly internal and of an economic
nature, although those in connection with Spain's West Indian
possessions were almost as vexing. For many years of this period Spain
was more or less in a state of anarchy, and labor disturbances
throughout the country took on a most violent form. In recent years,
however, conditions <span class="pagenum"><a id="page207" name="page207"></a>(p. 207)</span> have improved considerably and to-day the
future of Spain is more promising than it has been for many decades.</p>

<p>In foreign politics Spain did not play a very important part, especially
not since the loss of most of its colonies. It participated in a number
of the more important international conferences held during the last
thirty-five or forty years and, generally speaking, managed to maintain
friendly relations with most of the other nations. During the long
regency of Queen Marie Christine her personal influence, of course, was
bound to be felt to a considerable extent and to that extent Spain may
be said to have been more inclined toward the Central European Powers
and especially toward Austria than toward any other countries. This is
due to the fact that the Queen Regent was a member of the Hapsburg
family and that one of her late husband's sisters is married to a prince
of the reigning house of Bavaria. On the other hand the Spanish people
are, of course, in customs and language, more closely related to the
French and Italian people and this racial relationship is found
expressed in a more or less strong sympathy for France. In 1906 King
Alfonso XIII married Princess Victoria of Battenberg, daughter of one of
the daughters of Queen Victoria of England and of a German prince, but
thoroughly English in her bringing up and sympathies. This alliance of
course brought Spain into closer contact with England. Considering these
various conditions it is clear that Spain has about as many sentimental
reasons for supporting the Allies as it has for supporting the Central
Powers, and this balanced its sentiments so well that its neutrality has
been really fair and sincere. The entrance of Portugal into the war,
however, may have an important bearing on Spain's future attitude.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>





<h2 class="b1"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page208" name="page208"></a>(p. 208)</span> CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="title">DENMARK, SWEDEN, NORWAY, HOLLAND, AND LUXEMBURG</p>


<p>The reasons for the neutrality which the three Scandinavian kingdoms
have maintained in the Great European War are chiefly economic and
geographical. Neither one alone nor all three combined are strong enough
in men or money to take sides with either the Allies or the Central
European Powers. Furthermore through their continued neutrality they
have been able to reap a rich harvest by means of an immensely extended
trade with practically all of the belligerents, especially, however,
with England, Germany, and Russia. These conditions of course influence
chiefly the official attitude of these countries, but have less
influence on popular opinion which is more or less subject to
sentimental influences. In that direction both Denmark and Norway lean
toward the Allies, while Sweden leans toward the Central European
Powers. Denmark has never forgotten or forgiven the mutilation which it
suffered at the hands of Prussia and Austria in 1864, and which resulted
in the loss of Schleswig-Holstein, a comparatively large slice of
Denmark. This resentment toward Germany has been intensified since then
by the severe measures which from time to time have been taken against
the inhabitants of northern Schleswig, who have adhered consistently to
their Danish language and customs. Its ruling family also is closely
related to the rulers of England and Russia.</p>

<p>The latter may also be said of the ruling family of Norway, but in the
case of Norway matters have been somewhat complicated by its peculiar
relation to Sweden. Up to 1905 these two countries were known as the
United Kingdoms of Sweden and Norway and were governed on the basis of a
very close union. In that year, however, the union was dissolved after
the Norwegians had shown for many years previous their dislike of
existing conditions. After the dissolution they chose as their <span class="pagenum"><a id="page209" name="page209"></a>(p. 209)</span>
king a Prince of Denmark who is married to a sister of King George of
England; this as well as the very fact that Sweden is leaning toward
Germany is chiefly responsible for Norway's sentimental preference for
the cause of the Allies.</p>

<p>Sweden's tendency to support the Central European Powers is based
primarily on its fear of and hatred for Russia. The former sentiment is
due to Russia's well-known desire for a port which is ice-free all year
around and which it could, of course, acquire by the conquest of Sweden.
The latter sentiment, which has always been strong in Sweden, has its
origin in Russia's conquest of the former Swedish province of Finland
and in the oppressive and most cruel treatment which Russia has given to
the populace of this unfortunate country which consistently have tried
to adhere to their Swedish habits and civilization. The fact that the
present Queen of Sweden is a German princess, closely related to the
imperial family as well as to some of the other German reigning
families, and that this Queen of Sweden is very popular in her adopted
country, undoubtedly also had some bearing on Sweden's attitude toward
the various countries at war.</p>

<p>Like Portugal and Spain, Holland of to-day is only a mere shadow of its
past glory. Most of its colonial possessions have passed out of its
hands. Those, however, that still remain are chiefly in the Far East and
are very valuable, especially Java. The possession of these colonies by
as small a country as Holland, of course, raised many difficult problems
of a financial and political nature. As a result, Holland's
participation in international politics was naturally very restricted,
and the general policy of the country was to maintain the strictest
neutrality and to keep up friendly relations with the rest of the world.
Its neutrality in the present war is based on the same reasons.
Furthermore, public sentiment is rather anti-English, partly as a result
of the resentment of English aggression during the Napoleonic wars,
which almost ended in the loss to Holland of its colonies, and partly as
a result of the intense sympathy felt for the Boers, who are of Dutch
descent, during the South African War. At the same time they have no
particularly strong liking <span class="pagenum"><a id="page210" name="page210"></a>(p. 210)</span> for Germany, suspecting it of
having designs on their absolute independence, which the Dutch guard
most jealously.</p>

<p>The history of Holland during the last fifty years is, therefore,
concerned chiefly with internal affairs, and covers few events of
international importance. Its chief claim to international fame rests on
its selection by the other civilized nations as the center of the
international peace conferences and the seat of the International Court
of Arbitration. On May 18, 1899, the First Peace Conference assembled at
The Hague at the invitation of Czar Nicholas II of Russia. In it there
participated, besides twenty-one European states, the United States,
Mexico, China, Japan, Persia, and Siam. During sessions lasting over ten
weeks international questions of the greatest importance, chiefly
relating to the conduct of war, were discussed. As a result the
convention adopted certain resolutions and declarations which modified
warfare on land and sea, and regulated it by means of certain rules
which were to be observed by all signatories. It also created a
permanent court of arbitration, consisting of eminent jurists from all
the countries represented, before which international disputes were to
be brought for pacific settlement. At the suggestion of the United
States (1904) the czar invited the countries to a second peace
conference, which met on June 15, 1907. Besides the former signatories,
all the South American States were represented. Its results were similar
to those of the first conference, and as the years passed by the various
countries concluded among each other a total of over 150 arbitration
treaties.</p>

<p>In spite of being the center of the modern peace movement, Holland found
it necessary for its own protection to keep up with the general increase
in armament which was carried on in Europe. In 1913 the Coast Defense
Bill provided for the fortification of Flushing and for the expenditure
of a comparatively large sum, and created considerable discussion and
some ill feeling, especially in England.</p>

<p>The Duchy of Luxemburg is ruled by the same dynasty that now occupies
the throne of Holland, the House of Orange-Nassau. Until 1866 it was a
member of the North German Federation, but <span class="pagenum"><a id="page211" name="page211"></a>(p. 211)</span> in 1867 a
conference of the powers, held at London, declared it to be neutral
territory, and ordered the demolition of its fortifications. At that
time the succession in both Holland and Luxemburg descended in the
direct male line only. William III was King of Holland and Grand Duke of
Luxemburg. In 1879 the king's only brother and his oldest son, and in
1881 the king's second son died. This left that branch of the house
without male heirs. In 1879 William III had married a second time, and
had chosen Emma, Princess of Waldeck-Pyrmont, one of the smallest German
states. In 1880 a daughter, the present Queen Wilhelmina, was born. As
the king was aging rapidly and was not likely to have any further issue,
it became necessary to change the law of succession, in order to prevent
Holland's throne from coming into the hands of the next male member of
the House of Orange-Nassau, the Duke of Nassau, who was practically a
German prince, and, therefore, not acceptable to Holland's people. In
1884 it was arranged that in case of lack of male issue the succession
in Holland should descend to direct female heirs. When, therefore,
William III died in 1890 his minor daughter became queen under the
regency of Queen Emma. Luxemburg, however, descended to the Duke of
Nassau, who, upon his death was succeeded by his son, and upon the
latter's death by his granddaughter, the present Grand Duchess Marie
Adelaide. Queen Wilhelmina, the idol of her people, assumed the reins of
government upon reaching her majority in 1898 after her mother's
skillful regency of eight years. In 1901 she married a German prince,
Henry, Duke of Mecklenburg. This marriage was blessed with one daughter,
Princess Juliana, who is heir apparent to the throne of Holland.
Otherwise, though, it did not prove very happy, and, therefore, did
certainly not increase Dutch friendship for Germany.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>



<h2 class="b1"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page212" name="page212"></a>(p. 212)</span> CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="title">SUMMARY OF POLITICAL HISTORY</p>


<p>From the preceding narration of the political histories of Europe's
nations during the last half century there stand out very clearly two
facts. All the bigger countries and even one or two of the smaller ones
displayed a strong desire for expansion and the gratification of this
desire resulted in a crude form of international cooperation between
various groups of nations, crude because each separate nation at all
times was guided primarily by its own interests and demanded cooperation
on the part of some other nation or nations much more readily than it
was willing to grant cooperation to its ally or allies.</p>

<p>The motive of this desire for expansion, it is true, was in all cases
chiefly an economic need. But the very fact that the various efforts at
expansion, at least in their early stages, found almost always popular
approval, shows that there usually was a secondary motive, a desire for
aggrandizement. For it is very rare, indeed, that public opinion
possesses sufficient foresight to either appreciate or be guided by
economic necessities, while undertakings which can be made to appeal to
the sentiments of jealousy, of nationalism, and of rivalry, readily find
public support. The second of these&mdash;nationalism&mdash;especially was
reawakened and in many an instance grew into chauvinism, endangering
frequently the peace of the world. This, in a way, was very remarkable;
for hand in hand with the increase of nationalism went an increase of
internationalism to a degree that never before had been achieved in the
history of the world. Indeed, for a considerable period it looked as if
the world nations were rapidly approaching that happy state when war
would be unnecessary because a peaceful method of adjusting
international difficulties had been found and had been universally
adopted. Whether the Great War of 1914 has destroyed all that was
accomplished in the years preceding to make peace lasting, or whether it
was <span class="pagenum"><a id="page213" name="page213"></a>(p. 213)</span> only one of the obstacles in the path of this
revolutionary undertaking, remains to be seen.</p>

<p>The international cooperation of which we have just spoken was, of
course, nothing new. For treaties have been signed and alliances have
been concluded between nations ever since they have been developed far
enough to be capable of definite, deliberate political efforts. But
never before have treaties and alliances been so plentiful or gone so
far, and only rarely have they resulted in such a definite alignment of
the European nations into two groups. The inception of this policy the
world owes to the great modern German statesman, Bismarck. It was
through his efforts that the Triple Alliance was created soon after the
Franco-Prussian War and after the foundation of the new German Empire
which chose as its companions Austria-Hungary and Italy. That Bismarck
built well then is clearly shown by the wonderful progress that Germany
especially has been able to make since the Triple Alliance was founded
and insured European peace for a long period of years. But that either
he did not build well enough for all exigencies or else that his
successors were not as capable as he, is shown equally clearly by the
fact that at the most crucial moment in Germany's modern history one
member of the Triple Alliance, Italy, deserted. The second group of
European nations, in a way, was the logical result of the first, for the
latter, as it were, left high and dry on the sea of international
cooperation the three powerful countries of England, France, and Russia.
At the time of the formation of the Triple Alliance France, of course,
was disabled through its defeat by Germany to such an extent that
alliances were, at least temporarily, out of the question. Its
wonderfully quick recovery soon changed that, however, and resulted in
very definite efforts on the part of French statesmen to form a
defensive alliance which would insure France from any aggressiveness on
the part of the Triple Alliance. This finally brought about the
Franco-Russian Alliance. That Russia was available then was due to the
fact that Germany's old intimacy with its eastern neighbor had received
a serious setback when it chose Austria as its ally. For, though Austria
and Russia had once been friends and for <span class="pagenum"><a id="page214" name="page214"></a>(p. 214)</span> a short time even
allies, conditions had changed and in modern times the interests of the
two countries had become so conflicting that an alliance was entirely
out of the question.</p>

<p>After France and Russia had gotten together it was not long before
England found it necessary to choose between these two international
groups. That in spite of its close racial relation to the Germanic
countries it preferred the Gallo-Slavic combination, was due to a number
of reasons. In the first place it was found easier to adjust whatever
conflicts there were between England on the one side and France and
Russia on the other than those in existence between England and Germany.
In the second place English modern culture was clearly more interested
in and more influenced by French than by German achievements. And last,
but not least, an alliance between Germany and England became
impossible, because in such an alliance neither country would have
gracefully yielded the leadership to the other, whereas in an
Anglo-Franco-Russian concert all England had to do was to signify its
willingness to join and the leadership was England's without question or
contest. It was England, then, which gave up its international isolation
later than any of the others. But it did not lose thereby; for just as
its Franco-Russian alliance assured to it cooperation against the Triple
Alliance, if such cooperation was needed, it secured to itself
protection for its immense Far Eastern interests by an alliance with the
new world power of the Far East, Japan.</p>

<p>The outbreak of the war of 1914, then, saw these two great groups of
nations: The Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy, and
the Quadruple Entente of England, France, Russia and Japan. To foretell
the result of the gigantic struggle in international relations is
obviously impossible. Its end may bring a revival of internationalism on
a greater scale than ever before, it may result in a new and severe
separatism, it may cause a rearrangement of the present alliances or it
may simply mean a return to the <i>status quo</i> of August, 1914.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>





<h2><span class="pagenum"><a id="page215" name="page215"></a>(p. 215)</span> PART II&mdash;THE BALKANS</h2>

<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="title">THE BALKAN PEOPLES</p>


<p>While it is of course impossible to assign the causes of the Great War
to any one circumstance, there can be no doubt that at least one of the
chief causes may be found in that snarl of diplomatic intrigues, whose
setting has been the Balkans peninsula. There is not a close student of
European history and politics who has not predicted the "Great European
War." Indeed, it required no special powers of prophecy to foresee that
this constantly smoldering, and sometimes blazing corner of Europe,
would one day burst into a sweeping conflagration. The chief cause of
this constant turmoil and conflict in the Balkans lay in its
geographical relation to the expansion plan of Austria and Germany and
all the other European states, the Balkans being the gate and roadway to
the Orient. The first essential to an understanding of the situation is
a general knowledge of the races and nations that inhabit this portion
of the European Continent.</p>

<p>As the reader of ancient history knows, it was within this territory
that the Macedon of Philip and Alexander was situated, their capital
being not far from the present city of Saloniki. Then came the great
eastern Roman Empire, which later developed into the Byzantine Empire,
whose inhabitants were the degenerated descendants of the ancient
Greeks. Western Rome was constantly threatened by the northern barbarian
tribes, so the Greek emperors of Byzantium were in perpetual conflict
with barbarian hordes that pressed down on them from the north, more
than once driving them within the walls of their capital, the present
Constantinople.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page216" name="page216"></a>(p. 216)</span> These northern barbarians were wild Slavic tribes which had
come out of the steppes of Russia and swept down the Balkan peninsula,
penetrating as far as Mt. Olympus itself. After them came a tribe of
Asiatic origin, the Volgars, so called because they had for a period
inhabited the banks of the Volga, and they first conquered and then
mixed with the Slavs who lived in that section which is now Bulgaria.</p>

<p>And finally came the Moslem Turks, who first conquered Asia Minor from
the degenerated Greeks, then took Constantinople from them in 1453.
After that the Turks swept up the entire Balkan peninsula, conquering
all except that little mountainous corner up against the Adriatic, which
is now Montenegro, and subjugating all the peoples, Greeks and Slavs
alike. Nor did the Turkish conquest stop here; it swept onward, up into
Europe, and was not definitely checked until it had advanced as far as
Vienna itself. Then the tide turned, and little by little the Turks were
driven back, until now they are on the very verge of being forced across
the Bosphorus. And as the Turkish flood ebbed, the Balkan peoples
gradually emerged, one after another springing up into independent
nationalities.</p>

<p>Now the two great forces that had been driving back the Turks during the
centuries were the Austrians and the Russians. And though these two
great Christian powers fought against the same enemy, there gradually
arose between them a bitter jealousy. Each was determined that the Turk
should be driven out of Europe, but each realized that their two paths
after the retreating Turk must soon converge in the Balkan peninsula.
Neither cared anything for the Christian peoples who had been and were
being oppressed by the Turks; that they were freed from this oppression
was merely incidental, though it was the pretext for much of the warfare
during this long period. But each of these two great powers coveted the
Balkan peninsula. To Austria Saloniki would be an excellent seaport
opening out on the Mediterranean, for the Adriatic was dominated by
Italy. Russia, on her part, had her eyes on the Bosphorus and the
Dardanelles, which would offer her an opening into the Mediterranean, to
which she had no access at all. Added to that, the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page218" name="page218"></a>(p. 218)</span> people of
the Balkans were Slavs, blood kindred of the Russians, and could
speedily be made into loyal subjects of the czar. Such was the situation
which gradually evolved; which became more and more acute as the Turks
retreated into the Balkan peninsula proper, across the Danube. And the
first of the two grim powers to lead the pursuit down into the peninsula
was Russia in 1877, when she hurled her armies over the Danube to
"liberate" the Bulgars. From then on the Balkan problem demanded the
most serious attention of European diplomats.</p>

<a id="img011" name="img011"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<a href="images/img011.jpg">
<img src="images/img011tb.jpg" width="300" height="414" alt="" title=""></a>
<p>Balkan States Before the First Balkan War.</p></div>

<p>But the Balkan peoples that emerged, as the Turkish flood receded, were
very different from those that had been engulfed four centuries
previously. The Greeks had accepted the conquest, they bent rather than
broke. Therefore the Turks had granted them special privileges. Their
church and its clergy were spared and even given full spiritual
authority over the other Christian peoples. But the Slavs fought
stubbornly, not giving way until all their leaders were slain, and what
culture they possessed was thoroughly wiped out. The Bulgars suffered
especially, because they dwelt in the less mountainous regions of the
peninsula. The Serbians could, occasionally, take refuge in the
mountains of Montenegro, where their traditions and national spirit
smoldered through the darker periods.</p>

<p>Just how many there were of these various peoples in the Balkans when
Russia invaded the peninsula nearly forty years ago can only be left to
surmise. In no country in the world has the question of population
caused so much bitter dispute as in the Balkans. Because of racial and
national jealousies, census figures have been deliberately padded and
falsified by church and state alike. This is especially true of that
part of the peninsula (Thrace and Macedonia) which was still under
Turkish rule when the First Balkan War broke out in 1912. Only in what
were then Serbia, Greece, and Bulgaria proper were genuine census
enumerations made.</p>

<p>Bulgaria claims to have had a population in 1910 of about 4,337,000,
this being increased by half a million after the two wars. Serbia
reported 2,900,000 in 1910, the new territory increasing this by more
than 1,500,000. In Greece the population <span class="pagenum"><a id="page219" name="page219"></a>(p. 219)</span> was 2,730,000 before
the wars and then became 4,400,000. Little Montenegro contributed
another 800,000 Serbs. In Albania the population has been estimated
roughly at 800,000. Add all these figures together, and the result is
the total population of the Balkan peninsula proper, less that which
covers what was still Turkish territory when the present war broke out.</p>

<p>It is in the proportionate numbers of the various races and
nationalities, however, that the greatest confusion and uncertainty
exists. Nowhere in the world is there such an intermingling of various
and differing peoples. Here official figures are especially misleading,
and should be considered only within the boundaries of Bulgaria, Serbia,
and Greece as they were before the Balkan wars. For the peninsula as a
whole the testimony or the reports of impartial foreigners who have
traveled through the country is likely to be far more trustworthy.</p>

<p>The consensus of opinion would indicate that along the seacoast the
Greeks predominate, and that they are also numerous in the large towns
and cities. In the interior they are not found much north of Saloniki,
and even in that city the majority of the population is Jewish. As
traders, as the business elements in the cities, however, they are found
even up in Varna and Bourgas in Bulgaria.</p>

<p>In the interior there can be no doubt that the Slavs are in the vast
majority over all the other peoples. The names of the smallest villages,
as indicated on Austrian maps, the most trustworthy that have been made,
are obviously Slavic. Down through Thrace, almost to Constantinople,
over to a few miles outside Saloniki, sweeping over almost into the
mountains of Albania, up to Montenegro, the people are Slavic.</p>

<p>The Slavs, again, are subdivided into two families: Serbs and Bulgars.
And here it is more difficult to distinguish the dividing line, for
although there is a marked difference between the characteristics of the
two peoples, both physical and temperamental, so nearly alike are their
languages that speech forms no sure guide to distinguishing, especially
in Macedonia, where dialects vary with a day's travel. The trend of
popular feeling seems the only guide.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page220" name="page220"></a>(p. 220)</span> The main population west of the Struma and nearly up to
Saloniki are Serb, descendants of the Serbs, who were the inhabitants of
the old Serb Kingdom and Empire in that region. In Thrace and east of
the Struma the people are Bulgars.</p>

<p>Next to the Slavs in importance come the Turks, but these are nowhere
found in a solid mass; they are scattered all over the peninsula, and
even up into Bosnia and Herzegovina in Austria. Nowhere are they more
numerous than in northern Bulgaria, along the banks of the Danube, and
in the seaport cities on the Black Sea&mdash;Varna and Bourgas. The Bulgarian
census figures give their number as about half a million in Bulgaria
proper&mdash;about a seventh of the total population. Bulgaria, though she
suffered most from the oppression and fanatical outbursts of the Turks
in the old days, has always been the most tolerant. Because of this
there was comparatively little emigration of the Turkish population
after freedom gave the Christian majority control. Serbia reports only
about 14,000 in her territory, but this is probably an underestimate.
Down in Macedonia and southern Thrace the Turkish element is naturally
very strong, increasing in mass toward Constantinople.</p>

<p>Of the minor race divisions the Albanians deserve first mention, not
only because of their number, but because of their being more
concentrated within a certain territory, which gives them some political
significance. Though they have certain fine primitive qualities, they
are not much higher in the scale of intelligence and civilization than
were our North American Indians in the early days of our history. It is
supposed that they are the direct descendants of the ancient Illyrians;
if this be so, they have certainly not developed at all in the past two
thousand years. The majority have long since accepted the Mohammedan
faith of the Turks, but they differ markedly from the Turks in that they
are rough in their manners, less fanatical in matters of religion,
though violently prejudiced against all their Christian neighbors.
Steady work of any kind is their horror. As a fighting force they can
give much trouble, but they are not yet sufficiently developed to form a
nation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page221" name="page221"></a>(p. 221)</span> Next to the Albanians come the Jews. These differ very much
from the Jews known to us in our American cities. They are the direct
descendants of the Jews who were driven out of Spain by Torquemada
during the Spanish Inquisition, and found refuge under the protection of
the sultan. They still speak a curious old obsolete Spanish that can be
understood by a Mexican or a Spaniard quite easily. The special
privileges and the life of comparative ease which they enjoyed under
Ottoman rule seems to have weakened them, for among them are not found
the men of marked ability in the fields of art, science, and philosophy
that may be found among the German or the Russian Jews. In Bulgaria,
where the Government has given them equal rights with its Christian
citizens, they number about 40,000, nearly all of them being engaged in
small commercial pursuits. Farther south they increase in number. In
Saloniki, now a Greek city, they form a huge majority of the total
population&mdash;about 100,000 out of a mixed population of 175,000.</p>

<p>The Wallachs or Vlachs are another considerable portion of the Balkan
population, especially in the mountain regions. They are generally
considered as Rumanians, and have enjoyed the special protection of the
Rumanian diplomatic agents in Turkey, but they differ somewhat from the
Rumanians in Rumania proper. A gentle, peaceful people, most of them are
engaged in pastoral pursuits, tending their flocks up in the mountains
in the summer and coming down into the lowlands in the winter. In some
places they have settled down to a civic life, as in Bersa, a town not
far out of Saloniki along the Monastir railroad, where the majority of
the population is Wallachian. It is said that their dialect is the
nearest approach to a survival of the ancient Latin of any spoken
tongue, from which it is deduced that they are the descendants of the
Roman colonists that were sent by Rome into this country when it was
under her rule.</p>

<p>Another scattered element are the Gypsies; they are especially numerous
in Bulgaria and Serbia. These people are the lowest in their standard of
living and culture of all the Balkan races. All of them speak Turkish,
but their natural tongue differs from any other Balkan dialect. Among
themselves they are known <span class="pagenum"><a id="page222" name="page222"></a>(p. 222)</span> as "Copts," which would rather
indicate a comparatively recent Egyptian origin. However, as they are
absolutely of no significance, either politically or in any other sense,
they need not be considered further.</p>

<p>Rumania, though not properly a Balkan State, has played some part in
Balkan politics. The Danube forms not only a political, but a natural
boundary, between Bulgaria and Rumania. Along either of their respective
banks the population is solidly Bulgarian or Rumanian; there has been
comparatively little mixing. Though Rumania boasts of a distinct
cultured class, and her larger cities, especially Bucharest, present all
the physical appearances of a higher order of civilization, on account
of the longer period of independence enjoyed from the Turk, it is
doubtful if the Rumanian people as a whole possess the hardy qualities
of the Serbians and Bulgars. At any rate the level of education among
the peasantry is much lower. In race the Rumanians are of Latin blood
with some admixture of Slavic. As has been stated elsewhere, they extend
as a people up into Transylvania and Bukowina in Austria, and into the
Russian province of Bessarabia.</p>

<p>As will now be seen, the Slavs, including both Bulgars and Serbs, form
the predominating element in the Balkans. Yet, in spite of the
similarity between their speech, they differ strongly in temperament, as
has already been stated. Possibly it is because of the mixture of
Asiatic blood in the Bulgars. The Bulgar, slow, heavy, inclined to be
morose and suspicious of all strangers, does not give so pleasant a
first impression. The Serb is light-hearted, inclined to be frivolous,
and is much more adaptable. Give the Bulgar a patch of ground and he
will immediately plant vegetables; the Serb will devote at least some of
it to flowers. Then will come the Greek trader and make a fatter profit
out of the product of their toil than either of them.</p>

<p>But what is of especial political significance, in considering these
various Balkan peoples, is the mutual distrust and hatred that exists
between them, sown and sedulously fostered by outside powers. For had
they been able to weld themselves into one people, one nation, they
would have been able to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page223" name="page223"></a>(p. 223)</span> withstand the aggressive intentions of
both Austria and Russia, presented a solid front to both those powers,
and able to maintain the independence and peace in the Balkans, and,
very possibly, no great war at present.</p>

<p>The Turk is universally hated, but he is not despised. Except when his
fanaticism is aroused there is no better neighbor than the Turk, he is
courteous, tolerant in his quieter moments, and very much inclined to be
a good fellow in the disposal of his money. Moreover, he is a hard
fighter, and that quality always excites respect. Nor is he at all
underhand&mdash;he never makes a good spy.</p>

<p>The Greek, and more especially the Greek who lives on Turkish soil, has
not possessed these qualities. He has accepted and bent to the Turk, and
in his rôle of a willing slave, he has played a very questionable part
toward the other Christian peoples. However, there is a political reason
for his unpopularity.</p>

<p>On account of his acceptance of Turkish rule the Greek was allowed
special privileges. The Turks acknowledged the Greek Church as the
representative of all the Christian peoples under their rule. This gave
the patriarch of the Greek Church not only a spiritual but a temporal
authority over the Bulgars and the Serbs, as well as over his own
people, a power which was backed by Turkish troops.</p>

<p>Putting aside those frantic outbursts of barbarity against the Christian
inhabitants of his country, of which the Turk has frequently been
guilty, yet never has he been so oppressive as the Greek patriarch.
Given power over the Slav population, the patriarch used it to its
limit. Not only did he tax them oppressively to support a church with
which they had no sympathy, but he used all efforts to stamp out every
little spark of national feeling that had survived the centuries of
Turkish rule. He forced Greek teachers on their children, and finally he
made it a crime for any Slav to be heard speaking his own tongue. It was
the aim to make all Turkish Christians into Greeks, and to attain this
end no means was too severe. Later, some years before the liberation of
Bulgaria, the sultan gave the Bulgars the right to establish a church of
their own. And then, when he could <span class="pagenum"><a id="page224" name="page224"></a>(p. 224)</span> no longer employ Turkish
troops to force adherence to his church, the patriarch did not hesitate
to organize secret bands of terrorists to take their place. And this
policy was followed up until just before the First Balkan War, then
resumed with renewed ferocity afterward in the territory acquired after
the Second Balkan War.</p>

<p>Between the Serbs and the Bulgars the hatred may be very intense at this
present moment on account of the Second Balkan War and because King
Ferdinand, helped by Austria and Germany, has at last accomplished his
long-prepared ambition to crush Serbia. When Bulgar meets Serb they
naturally fraternize. The prejudice between them is really artificial.
It has been partly created and wholly fanned into flame by the governing
cliques for political reasons. In fact, it may be said that all these
hatreds would gradually die out were it not for the artificial
irritation that has been kept up by the governing cliques of the
respective states. The fact that they could all combine against the
Turks in the First Balkan War seems evidence enough that union is not
impossible, if only the various kings and their supporters would
suppress their personal ambitions and greed and consider the welfare of
their respective people as of the first importance.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>




<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="title">BULGARIA</p>


<p>The present war is the logical sequel of the successive scenes of the
drama enacted in the Balkan theatre. And though original causes may be
found still farther back in history, by beginning with the liberation of
Bulgaria, the whole story may be fairly well unfolded. All students of
Balkan history are fairly well agreed on the point that the Treaty of
Berlin is responsible for most of the troubles that have come since.</p>

<p>At that time in 1877 Turkey still controlled all of the Balkan Peninsula
except Greece, including Bosnia, Herzegovina, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page225" name="page225"></a>(p. 225)</span> Rumania.
Rumania, Serbia, and Montenegro, however, were only nominally part of
Turkey, since they were allowed to have their own ruling princes and
enjoyed almost complete independence. The Bulgars were still governed by
Turkish pashas, and were in no way allowed to participate in their own
government.</p>

<p>For many years there had been revolutionary activities among them, whose
aim was to prepare and stir up the peasants to active revolt against the
rule of the Turks. It was part of Russia's policy to encourage these
conspirators, for a strong revolutionary uprising might always be the
opportunity for intervention and ultimate annexation.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1876 a slight uprising took place under the leadership
of some schoolmasters, some of whom had been educated in Russia and had
there imbibed the Panslavist idea: the ultimate union of all Slavs under
the autocracy of the czar.</p>

<p>At first the uprising attracted little attention; it had occurred down
in southern Rumania, not far from Philippopolis. Nor did its suppression
at first attract notice, until MacGhan, the American correspondent of an
English newspaper, went down to the scene of the troubles and began
sending in reports to his paper, and as the European public read these
descriptions in the British newspaper, their indignation rose and
presently swept all over Europe in a storm of fury against the Turks.</p>

<p>These were what afterward became known as the Bulgarian atrocities. The
villagers of Batak had been preparing for some days to join the
insurrection when a force of bashi-bazouks, Turkish irregulars, under
the command of Achmet Agha and Mohammed Agha arrived at the place. On
the two Turkish leaders giving their word of honor that no harm should
come to them, the villagers surrendered. No sooner had they laid down
their arms than a general massacre of the whole population began; not
only the men, but women and children were tortured, outraged, and hacked
to pieces. When a British commission appeared on the scene two months
later to investigate, the little village church was still piled up to
the windows with the corpses of those that had fled there for sanctuary.
Skulls with gray hairs still attached to them, tresses which had once
adorned the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page226" name="page226"></a>(p. 226)</span> heads of young girls, and the rotting limbs of
small children were mingled in one gruesome heap. It is said that the
Ottoman High Commissioner, who was sent by the Turkish Government with
the British commission to investigate, on beholding this sight, turned
to one of the perpetrators who was present and asked him how much Russia
had paid him for a deed which, as he phrased it, would be "the beginning
of the end of the Ottoman Empire." The Turkish Government evidently did
not share this pessimistic view, for it decorated the two Turks who had
led the bashi-bazouks in the massacre.</p>

<p>It presently developed that Batak was not an isolated example. Mr.
Baring of the British commission estimated that the total number of
Bulgars slaughtered in that district during the month of May must have
been 12,000. In Batak 5,000 out of a population of 7,000 had been
killed.</p>

<p>Never was Europe more aroused. Mr. Gladstone's famous pamphlet,
denouncing the Turkish administration in its European provinces, went
through edition after edition. Lord Derby, on behalf of the British
Government, telegraphed that "any renewal of the outrages would be more
fatal to the Turkish Government than the loss of a battle." Bulgaria,
which had been forgotten for centuries, became a household word. All
over the world swept a fierce popular demand that the Turk be
immediately driven out of Europe.</p>

<p>Here was Russia's opportunity. In the face of this world-wide popular
sentiment the policy of the European powers, especially of Austria, that
Russia should not be allowed to acquire more Turkish territory, could
not very well be enforced. The Austrian diplomat who would object to
Russia hurrying to the aid of the outraged Bulgars, her own blood
kindred, would have been mobbed in his own country. The hearts of people
were so moved that they forgot the dark intrigues of diplomats.</p>

<p>So in the following spring Russia declared war against Turkey, and
Rumania taking this opportunity to declare her complete independence,
sent an army into the field to aid the Russians. The Bulgars,
unorganized and untrained as they were, also gave what aid they could,
especially in the storming of Shipka Pass, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page227" name="page227"></a>(p. 227)</span> through which the
invaders burst out into the plains of Thrace and advanced triumphantly
on to the gates of Constantinople. Then the Turks cried for terms, and
the famous Treaty of San Stefano, drawn up in the small town by that
name just outside the Turkish capital, was the result.</p>

<p>By this treaty there would have been created the "Greater Bulgaria," of
which the Bulgarians have been dreaming of and fighting for ever since.
The Bulgaria of the San Stefano Treaty would have cut the European
territories of the sultan in two, and thus effectively dismembered the
Ottoman Empire. In addition to a coast line on the Black Sea extending a
little farther north, and considerably farther south than Bulgaria now
possesses, she would have had a frontage on the Ægean Sea. Practically
all of Macedonia, over to the lakes of Ochrida and Prespa, and down to
near Saloniki, would have been included; the Vardar and the Struma would
have been Bulgarian streams from their sources to their mouths.</p>

<p>But by this time the great popular indignation against the Turks had
spent itself and the diplomatic machinery of the powers began revolving
again. England, who had protested against the Bulgarian atrocities
strongest, was the first to veto the plan that was to give all the
Bulgarians their independence of Turkey. To Lord Beaconsfield, Disraeli,
himself one of a race which has suffered oppression for centuries, and
then prime minister of Great Britain, belongs the honor of being the
first diplomat to set in motion that intervention by the powers which
was to give the Bulgars of Macedonia back into the hands of the Turks.</p>

<p>There was a conference of the powers in Berlin, and there it was decided
that the Treaty of San Stefano must be revised. The reason was that it
was feared that Bulgaria would become merely a Russian province; that
through Bulgaria Russia would all but have her hands on the Bosphorus,
the aim of all her ambitions. So the Treaty of San Stefano was torn up
and the Treaty of Berlin was substituted in its place.</p>

<p>By this new document, which was in force practically up until the First
Balkan War, Bulgaria was created an "autonomous and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page228" name="page228"></a>(p. 228)</span> tributary
principality under the suzerainty of his Imperial Majesty the Sultan";
its limits were defined to be the Balkans on the south, eastern Rumelia
being thus excluded from it; the Danube on the north, the Black Sea from
just south of Mangalia to near Cape Emineh on the east, and Serbia on
the west from the point where the Timok River joins the Danube to the
point at which the two principalities and Macedonia should meet. Thus
were not only the Bulgars of eastern Rumelia and Macedonia separated
from their kinsmen in the new principality, but the district of Pirot
was handed over to Serbia, who had participated in both wars of 1876 and
of 1877-78. Austria's share in the spoils was Bosnia and Herzegovina,
though ostensibly these two provinces were only to be under her
temporary administration. The Berlin Treaty also provided for certain
reforms of the Turkish Government in the Macedonian provinces, but as
these were never carried out, and were never expected to be carried out
by either the Turkish or European statesmen concerned, these provisions,
known as "Article XXIII of the Treaty of Berlin," need not be described.
This article was a mere sop thrown to whatever might be left of that
public opinion which had thundered through Europe a year previously.
Macedonia was handed back body and soul to Turkey, to be done with as
she pleased. Herein was the cause of all the trouble that was to follow;
one of the chief causes of the present Great War.</p>

<p>It would be a mistake, however, to assume that Russia's motives had been
entirely or even largely altruistic. The powers had expressed the fear
that a greater Bulgaria would gradually become part of the Russian
Empire. There can be no doubt that Russia thought so too. All her later
actions point to that fact. The only mistake, and this was shared by all
who participated in the Treaty of Berlin alike, was the assumption that
Bulgaria herself would allow this to be done. It only developed later
what a stiff-necked people the Bulgars could be.</p>

<p>Bulgaria, as Prince Bismarck expressed it, had been put into the saddle.
Her next task was to learn to ride. Under the rule of the Turks there
had been no opportunity to acquire political <span class="pagenum"><a id="page229" name="page229"></a>(p. 229)</span> or administrative
experience; all the public offices had been filled by Turks or Greeks.
All the natural leaders of the people having been killed off by Turks
and Greeks alike for centuries, the Bulgars that emerged into
independence in 1878 were essentially a nation of peasants. There were
very few of them who could read or write; there were no printed
Bulgarian books. Small wonder if all Europe and Russia thought that
these people would not be able to govern themselves.</p>

<p>Until the Government of the new little nation could be organized and a
ruler chosen, a Russian prince was left in the country, with a Russian
army to support him to maintain order. And he acted indeed as though he
were governing a Russian province. He gave the Bulgarians a taste of
what real Russian authority might be like, and they did not like it.
This was Russia's first mistake in her capacity as guide through the
first difficulties of self-government.</p>

<p>Eventually, however, a General Assembly was called, a constitution
drafted and the first ruler was selected. The choice fell on Prince
Alexander of Battenberg, a nephew of the Russian Czar Alexander II. At
the time of his election he was only twenty-two years of age, and lived
as a simple military officer in the barracks of Potsdam in Germany. It
is said that he asked the advice of Bismarck, when his election first
became known to him, as to whether he should accept, and that Bismarck
replied, "at least, a reign in Bulgaria will always be a pleasant
reminiscence." Bismarck was one of those who had drafted the Treaty of
Berlin and had no faith in the stability of any possible government the
Bulgars could organize for themselves. On July 9, 1879, Prince Alexander
took the oath to the constitution at Tirnovo. A week later the Russian
army of occupation evacuated the country.</p>

<p>But if the Russian soldiers had left the country there were still plenty
of Russians left in Bulgaria. The president of the council, the minister
of war, the chief of police, the governor of Sofia, the capital, and 300
superior officers in the Bulgarian army that was presently organized,
were all Russians. The Russian agent, M. Hitrovo, cleverly worked on the
national dread <span class="pagenum"><a id="page230" name="page230"></a>(p. 230)</span> of Austria, and tried to play the part of a
British political resident at the court of an Indian prince.</p>

<p>This continued until 1883, when suddenly Prince Alexander dismissed all
his Russian advisers, and Bulgarians were established in their places.
Naturally, Russia was enraged. By this time Alexander's uncle, the Czar
of Russia, had died, and Czar Alexander III, his cousin, was now ruler
of Russia.</p>

<p>One night not long after the dismissal of the Russian advisers two
Russian generals, Skobeleff and Kaulbars, arrived at the palace and
demanded an audience of the prince. The sentry refused them admittance,
and when they attempted to force their way past him the soldier drew his
side arm and threatened to strike them down. The guard was called; a
carriage which stood at the palace gates and from which the two Russian
generals had alighted was searched, and evidence was discovered that the
prince was to have been kidnapped to the Danube, thence over into
Russia. Proclamations announcing Alexander's expulsion from Bulgaria,
and the formation of a provisional government under the two leading
conspirators, proved conclusively the complicity of Russia. Thanks to
the support that he received from the Bulgarian officers about him,
Alexander was saved and the plot was exposed to Russia's humiliation.
Also, it showed the Bulgars to what measures Russia would resort to
force her will upon them.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>




<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="title">WAR WITH SERBIA</p>


<p>Meanwhile down in Eastern Rumelia the bitter disappointment caused by
the separation of the two Bulgarias by the Treaty of Berlin had
increased. On the morning of September 18, 1885, as Gavril Pasha, the
Turkish governor, was quietly sipping his coffee in his home in
Philippopolis a group of Bulgarian officers rushed in and took him
prisoner. The pasha yielded to superior force; without the shedding of a
drop of blood <span class="pagenum"><a id="page231" name="page231"></a>(p. 231)</span> the revolutionists took possession. Union with
Bulgaria was proclaimed. Prince Alexander, fearing the international
complications that might follow, hesitated, but his Bulgarian advisers
insisted, so on September 20 he issued a proclamation announcing himself
as "Prince of North and South Bulgaria."</p>

<p>Naturally, in the commotion among the diplomats which followed, it might
be supposed that those who had drafted the Treaty of Berlin would insist
on its being observed, and that Russia would welcome the Greater
Bulgaria she had planned at San Stefano. But just the contrary happened.
England, now under the guidance of Gladstone, threatened a naval
demonstration before the Dardanelles if Turkey interfered. Russia, on
her part, was furious; she pressed Turkey to march an army up into south
Bulgaria. Turkey, however, had no desire to be interviewed by the
British ships.</p>

<p>Thus Russia and England had changed places in their attitude toward
Bulgaria. Both had realized that they had made a mistake seven years
previously; that Bulgaria herself would have a word to say as to whether
she was to become a Russian province. Having failed to persuade Turkey
to take military steps to bring Eastern Rumelia back under her rule,
Russia now turned to Serbia. Greece and Serbia were also furious that
Bulgaria should suddenly acquire territory without their having a share
in it, thus making her the biggest nation of the Balkans. So Serbia and
Russia intrigued together. The result was that, like the proverbial bolt
out of a clear sky, Serbia hurled a declaration of war at Bulgaria and
began marching her army across the frontier toward Sofia.</p>

<p>The Bulgarian army was in Eastern Rumelia at the time, expecting trouble
from the Turks. When the news came that the Serbians were attacking them
from the rear, they began rushing up north. They packed themselves into
the box cars on the railroad like dried fish, and they clung to the tops
like insects. Meanwhile the people of Belgrade toasted their sovereign,
King Milan, as "King of Serbia and Macedonia."</p>

<p>Three days later the Serbian army was well on the road over the frontier
toward the Bulgarian capital. Suddenly, at Slivnitza, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page232" name="page232"></a>(p. 232)</span> a small
town just over the frontier, the Bulgars burst down on them. At their
head rushed a brigade of 3,000 Macedonian "brigands," natives of that
territory that the Treaty of Berlin had cut off from Bulgaria. With the
Bulgarian army was also a corps of 6,000 Mohammedan volunteers who
rushed into the battle with as much enthusiasm as their Christian
fellows. At that moment Bulgaria reaped the benefits of the tolerance
she had shown the Mohammedan population during the seven years of her
independence. They were now good Bulgarian citizens.</p>

<p>The war with Serbia lasted just three days. At the end of that time the
Serbians were flying, a panic-stricken mob, back across the frontier
toward Belgrade, the Bulgars at their heels. At their head, in the midst
of the flying bullets, rode Prince Alexander. The war was won in spite
of the fact that all the Russian officers, acting on secret instruction
from home, had resigned on the day before the battle.</p>

<p>The Bulgarian army had already advanced to and occupied Pirot, and was
preparing to continue on to Belgrade, when Count Khevenhüller, the
Austrian Minister to Serbia, arrived at Bulgarian headquarters and
informed Prince Alexander that if the Bulgarians continued their advance
the Serbians would be joined by Austrian troops. The prince yielded to
superior force, and in March, 1886, a treaty of peace was signed at
Bucharest. Serbia did not cede a single yard of territory, nor did she
pay one cent of indemnity. Not only Russia, but Austria, was beginning
to fear Bulgaria; neither wanted a really formidable power in the
Balkans. But at any rate the union with Eastern Rumelia was accomplished
and remained a fact.</p>

<p>Again Russian intrigue had failed; again Bulgaria had not only shown her
capacity for managing her own affairs, but she had also shown that her
soldiers could fight. All Europe was surprised. It was not supposed that
the army of this little nation, whose people only eight years ago had
been all slaves, could meet trained troops in action.</p>

<p>Russia now made immediately another mistake in attributing her
humiliation to Prince Alexander, the good-natured boy who was supposed
to rule Bulgaria. She was now determined to be <span class="pagenum"><a id="page233" name="page233"></a>(p. 233)</span> revenged on
him. Nor did the Russian agents wait long before taking action. Peace
had hardly been declared between Bulgaria and Serbia when they began
laying their plans.</p>

<p>A rumor having been spread that the Serbians were going to resume their
attack, all the troops were taken out of Sofia and sent away toward the
frontier. Then a regiment, on which the conspirators, the Russian agents
and some Bulgarian officers whom they had bribed, felt they could count,
was smuggled into the capital. At two o'clock in the morning on August
21, 1886, the Bulgarian officers in the pay of the conspirators rushed
into the palace, forced the prince at the point of a revolver to sign
his own abdication, then kidnapped him in a carriage, taking him off to
the Danube, where he was put on board of a boat under heavy guard and
taken to Russia.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the conspirators, among whom was the metropolitan of the
Bulgarian Church, Clement, issued a proclamation establishing themselves
as the provisional government, and assuring the people that it would
have the hearty support of the "Little White Father" in St. Petersburg.</p>

<p>This proclamation had hardly been launched when Stambuloff, the Speaker
of the National Assembly, issued another proclamation, in his official
capacity, in which he declared the metropolitan, Clement, and the other
known conspirators outlaws, and appealed to the Bulgarian people to
defend the independence of their Government. And the people did rise to
his support, all over the country, so decidedly and with so much
enthusiasm that the members of the provisional government fled.
Thereupon Stambuloff and two other officials of the National Assembly
assumed control of the Government until the prince could be found.
Telegrams were sent all over Europe, and finally the Russian authorities
were obliged to set the prince free, whereupon he reappeared in Lemberg,
whence he returned to Bulgaria.</p>

<p>But the experience had apparently thoroughly frightened the prince. On
landing at Rustchuk on the Danube, he sent a telegram to the czar,
saying: "Russia gave me my crown; I am ready to return it to her
sovereign." So on September 7, in spite of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page234" name="page234"></a>(p. 234)</span> protests of
Stambuloff and the other members of the Government, he abdicated in
earnest and next day he left Bulgaria forever.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>




<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="title">WORK OF STAMBULOFF</p>


<p>A delegation was then sent wandering around Europe for another
sovereign, and after much difficulty the final choice fell on Prince
Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, whose mother, Princess Clementine, was
the granddaughter of King Louis Philippe, his father being an Austrian
nobleman of large means. On August 14, 1887, he took the oath and was
installed on the throne which he still occupies, though now as king. He
immediately did what made him ever afterward bitterly hated by the
Russian Government, namely, requested Stambuloff, he who had uncovered
Russia's latest intrigue and conspiracy, to become prime minister, a
post which he occupied for the next seven years, constantly fighting
Russian influence.</p>

<p>Stephen Stambuloff, the son of an innkeeper, born in 1854, and one of
the early revolutionary agitators among his own people, has often been
referred to as the "Bismarck of the Balkans." He was, undoubtedly, the
biggest statesman that the Balkans has yet produced, unless time shall
decide that Venizelos is another such as he.</p>

<p>In the hands of Stambuloff Prince Ferdinand was nothing but a puppet,
and so he continued for some years, until he became acquainted with the
language, customs, and mental qualities of his people. Then the two fell
out. But to the end Stambuloff was the real ruler, and under his
guidance Bulgaria made that progress, both in military organization and
in education, which was the surprise of the world when the First Balkan
War broke out. It now dawned on Russia that it was Bulgaria herself that
was opposed to her intrigues and not the princes who happened to occupy
her throne. And the leader of the Bulgarians was <span class="pagenum"><a id="page235" name="page235"></a>(p. 235)</span> undoubtedly
Stambuloff, a peasant himself and the son of a peasant. His downfall
must be brought about.</p>

<p>From the very beginning of his reign Ferdinand had not been recognized
by the Russian Government. As he began to feel himself more secure in
his throne he began to work for this recognition, as well as for the
favor of all the reigning monarchs of Europe. With this end in view he
began intriguing, and as an intriguer, Ferdinand is the cleverest of all
the Balkan monarchs. Thus it was that he finally dismissed Stambuloff
from office on May 31, 1894, an act which he found all the easier
because Stambuloff had made many enemies among his own people by his
brusque, almost brutal, ways. But in spite of the wave of unpopularity
that happened to be sweeping over him at the time, there could be no
doubt that a man of Stambuloff's abilities would again rise to power.
Only one thing could prevent that. And that one thing was brought to
pass by his enemies. In the evening of July 15, 1895, as he was driving
home from his club, three men sprang up on his carriage and literally
hacked him to pieces. Thus ended the comparatively short career of the
man who had most to do with defeating Russian intrigues in Bulgaria. His
murderers, though identified, were never arrested or punished, and found
safe refuge in Russia.</p>

<p>But for all that his enemies gained by his death, Stambuloff might as
well have continued to live. One of the strongest political parties in
Bulgaria is still named after him, and bases its appeal on his policies.
And ever after every Bulgarian who knows the short history of his
country has hated the Russian Government, though this sentiment does not
include the Russian people. In fact, nowhere in all Europe have Russian
political exiles found more secure refuge than in Bulgaria, where they
are received with hearty welcome, and the abler ones of them offered
Government employment. As an instance: the national university in Sofia
was founded by a Russian scholar upon the invitation of the Bulgarian
Government. Had this same Russian scholar dared to cross over the
Russian frontier he would have been arrested immediately, and, if not
hung, have been sent into exile to Siberia. Again and again Russia has
demanded that <span class="pagenum"><a id="page236" name="page236"></a>(p. 236)</span> certain notable refugees living in Bulgaria be
delivered up to her, but always Bulgaria has refused. The Bulgars love
the Russian people; they hate the Russian autocracy.</p>

<p>Meanwhile important events were developing down in Macedonia. The people
throughout this region, with the exception of the few Greeks along the
sea shores, had been bitterly disappointed by the Treaty of Berlin,
which delivered them back into the hands of the Turks. It soon became
obvious that even the reforms promised by the XXIII Article of that
document were to remain meaningless; the Turkish Government did not even
pretend to put them into effect.</p>

<p>During this period many young Macedonian peasant boys crossed the
frontier over into free Bulgaria, where the excellent schools being
established offered them opportunity to obtain an education that had
never before been available to Bulgars. These young fellows returned to
Macedonia unobtrusively and quietly by exerting their influence on the
peasants. At first they merely instructed them in reading and writing;
then they inaugurated evening gatherings where things of the outside
world were discussed. Two of the most prominent of these young educators
were Damyan Grueff and Gotze Deltcheff, now worshipped by the common
peasants as the martyr heroes of their movement for freedom.</p>

<p>It was Grueff and Deltcheff who first gave these early efforts a
definite turn. They began organizing the villagers into societies whose
object was distinctly revolutionary. But during all their careers
neither of these two men advocated union with Bulgaria. Later on, as
will be shown, they became bitterly opposed to that idea, as did all of
their followers and disciples. They wanted to create a program for their
organization which should be acceptable to all the people of Macedonia;
Greeks, Serbs, Vlachs and even Mohammedans, as well as Bulgars. So they
preached the idea of "Macedonia for the Macedonians;" Macedonia to be
either an entirely separate nation by itself, or an autonomous state,
under Turkish suzerainty.</p>

<p>Their organization had a more immediate purpose, however. And that was
to establish some sort of order in the midst of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page237" name="page237"></a>(p. 237)</span> Turkish
anarchy. The trouble with the Turkish rule was not that it ruled too
much, but that it ruled too little. Brigands, both Mohammedan and
Christian, ranged the mountain regions, preying on the poor peasants.
Turkish troops made no special efforts to check them. Turkish courts
were so corrupt that justice was a joke. Though there was a tendency on
the part of the courts to favor their own people, all other things being
equal, still that was not the chief grievance of the Macedonian
peasants. The trouble was that the courts could always be bought and a
case always went against the poor man, whether he was Christian or
Mohammedan. And finally, in some sections of Macedonia, especially down
around Monastir, toward the Greek frontier, the Greek Church was still
enjoying the same authority over Bulgar communities that it had once
enjoyed up in Bulgaria. To add to this trouble, the Greek patriarch was
again attempting to push his propaganda all over the country, employing
armed bands to terrorize the villagers into declaring themselves Greeks.
This, of course, was a campaign carried on in conjunction with the Greek
Government, which wished to Hellenize Macedonia against the day when
Turkey should be driven out, so that it could lay claim to the country
on the strength of "blood kindred."</p>

<p>Over and over again the Bulgar communities sent delegations to the
Turkish padisha complaining of these evils, but no measures were ever
taken to remedy them. The brigands continued unmolested, the courts
remained corrupt and as for curtailing the power of the Greek Church,
that was distinctly against the policy of the sultan. With the Bulgars
in overwhelming majority, he considered it wise to confer his privileges
on the fewer Greeks, thus to rouse a mutual hatred between the two
peoples, so they should not join together and make common cause against
him.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>




<h2 class="b1"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page238" name="page238"></a>(p. 238)</span> CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class="title">ATTEMPTS AT REFORM IN MACEDONIA</p>


<p>The first object of the organization which Grueff and Deltcheff set
about forming was to remedy this evil. In each village they established
a local committee, composed of the more intelligent villagers, whose
function it should be to take the place of the Turkish courts. The
members of these secret tribunals were elected democratically by the
villagers themselves. Later on they elected local delegates to
provincial committees, which acted as courts of higher appeal, to which
a defendant on trial might appeal should he feel that local sentiment
was prejudiced against him. Later on, when these committees spread all
over the country, yearly congresses were held, the first of which drew
up a constitution for what was nothing less than a secret provisional
government for the underground republic of Macedonia. Such was the
beginning and the first purposes of the famous Macedonian Committee, so
called because authority was always vested in the hands of committees,
rather than with individuals, so strong was the democratic sentiment of
the people.</p>

<p>The next thing was to get rid of the brigands. To accomplish that the
provincial committees organized and maintained armed bands, which
patrolled the mountains of the territory assigned to them. Numbering all
the way from ten men to fifty each, these bands protected the villages
from the bandits and even hunted them down. And, naturally, when the
terrorist bands of the Greek Church became active, they were confronted
by the armed bands of the committee.</p>

<p>It is notable that when the existence of the Macedonian Committee and
its small local armed forces first became known to the outside world, it
was not the Turkish Government which showed most animosity. In fact, for
a long time the Turks rather treated the committee much as they had
treated the brigands; that is, let them alone, so long as they did not
cross their path, and the committee did not set out to molest the Turks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page239" name="page239"></a>(p. 239)</span> It was the Greek Church, and the Greek and Serbian Governments
that became most excited. Both the Greeks and the Serbians had been
making every effort to arouse a "spirit of nationalism" of their own
brand among the Macedonians. The committee was distinctly going to
counteract their influence and efforts by arousing a spirit of
nationality among the Macedonians which was neither Serbian nor
Bulgarian nor Greek. And when the Bulgarian Government understood this
thoroughly it showed itself equally unfriendly. For Prince Ferdinand and
his clique dreamed of the Greater Bulgaria which they should rule. They
wanted no autonomous Macedonia; even less did they want an independent
Macedonia.</p>

<p>It was along in the later nineties that the Macedonian Committee began
assuming such proportions as to attract the attention of the Balkan
Governments. They began preparations for counteracting its influence,
even for its destruction. So they organized armed bands, commanded by
army officers "on furlough," or, in some cases, by the very brigand
chiefs whom the committee had driven out. These bands were sent across
the frontier to "arouse the national spirit" among the peasants.</p>

<p>From the very first the Bulgarian bands fought the forces of the
committee as did the Greeks. Neither ever penetrated very far into the
country from their respective frontiers, for the peasants were opposed
to them and would not feed them, though they had plenty of money and did
succeed in bribing some. They did, however, do a great deal of damage
among the villages near the frontiers and, instead of arousing any
national spirit, only planted a deep hatred in the hearts of the
Macedonians for their respective governments. But of the three forces,
Greek, Bulgarian, and Serbian, the Bulgars and Greeks were by far the
most ferocious. The Serbs were inclined to fight fair, attacking only
the committee's bands and such villages as sheltered them. The Greeks
and Bulgars knew no such restrictions. They burned whole villages,
massacred whole communities, including women and children, and
frequently outraged women. And wherever they left their bloody marks
behind, there they also left the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page240" name="page240"></a>(p. 240)</span> official seal of their
master, rudely drawn on rocks or charred timbers&mdash;a bishop's miter and
cross.</p>

<p>Between the committee's armed forces and the propagandist bands sent
over by Prince Ferdinand's Government there were open hostilities. The
peasants complained to the committee that some of Ferdinand's band
leaders, those who had formerly been brigands, were beginning to resort
to their old practices, though now they described their robberies as
"contributions to the cause of the revolution." The Macedonians fought
Bulgars as bitterly and fiercely as they fought Greeks and Serbs. For
months a bloody war was waged in the mountain forests of northern
Macedonia. The committee's forces had the support of the population. The
invaders had the advantage of a bigger supply of arms and ammunition,
and that finally told. Little by little the bands of the committee were
driven back. And just at that juncture an authority of the organization,
the Executive Committee, was betrayed by a Greek spy. These leaders, who
had charge of the organization's funds, were arrested and imprisoned.
Without funds the bands in the field were cut off from further supplies
of arms and ammunition, which had been supplied in large part by illicit
Greek and Turkish traders.</p>

<p>Only two leaders, and less than a hundred armed men, were left in
northern Macedonia to resist the further advance of the Bulgarian
propagandists.</p>

<p>In 1901 a Macedonian leader, whose headquarters were in Thrace and in
the country east of the Struma, of the name of Yani Sandanski, who later
became prominent in connection with the Young Turk movement, kidnapped
the American missionary, Miss Ellen Stone, and held her for a ransom of
$60,000. His desperate venture succeeded. The ransom was paid, arms and
ammunition were bought in large quantities, and his committee was able
to meet the Bulgarian propagandists with stronger forces than ever in
the country east of the Struma. The committee had men in plenty.</p>

<p>The Miss Stone episode, however, had given the Macedonian situation a
great deal of publicity in the Bulgarian press, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page241" name="page241"></a>(p. 241)</span> the
Bulgarian public began protesting. Thousands of students in Bulgaria
were Macedonians; others were government officials. Thousands also were
prospering merchants. Popular demonstrations against Ferdinand's policy
were reported all over the country, and finally he was compelled to
withdraw his armed forces from Macedonia. Thus was his first intrigue in
that direction defeated.</p>

<p>It should be obvious by this time that the Macedonian Committee was the
key to the whole Balkan problem, in so far as it was an internal problem
at least. All the little states surrounding Macedonia wanted to grab
her, and Macedonia did not want to be grabbed by any of them. In their
selfish greed the governing cliques of all the little states absolutely
disregarded the will of the people of Macedonia. In their efforts they
were only reviving the old hatreds and creating new ones. Little wonder
that the Turks sat back and refrained from interfering too actively.
Meanwhile the people of Europe, seeing that the Balkan Christians fought
more among themselves than they fought the Turks, believed they were
only barbarians, little dreaming that the fight was not so much between
Turk and Christian, as between Democracy and Imperialism; the democracy
of the Macedonians against the imperialistic ambitions of the selfish
little states around them. This point should be realized and emphasized,
for this fight culminated in the next big act of the Balkan drama; the
rise of Young Turkey.</p>

<p>If the little Balkan States were opposed to the Macedonian Committee,
for the very same reason Russia and Austria were opposed, though to
these two powers it was not so vital a matter. For the present they,
with the rest of Europe were maintaining the <i>status quo</i>. For a number
of years Russia had been busy in another quarter in the Far East, and
had not much thought to give to the Balkans. Then came her defeat at the
hands of the Japanese in 1905 and her hopes of emerging on the open sea
in that direction were effectually doomed. Austria, too, was willing to
defer the realization of her ambitions, so long as Russia made no move.
Yet both realized that they must do battle for their interests in the
Balkans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page242" name="page242"></a>(p. 242)</span> In 1903 the Macedonian Committee, rendered desperate by the
pressure of the Greek, Bulgar, and Serbian propagandists, as well as by
the Turks, who were beginning to take more active measures against the
"comitlara," or "committee people," as they called the revolutionists,
precipitated an uprising in the Monastir district, under the leadership
of Damyan Grueff, Deltcheff having been killed by soldiers some time
previous. The object was not so much a successful revolution as to
create a crisis in the Balkan problem; to disturb the <i>status quo</i> of
the European statesmen. For, as Grueff expressed it, "horror with an end
is better than horror without an end."</p>

<p>The uprising was suppressed with the customary Turkish severity, though
not with such atrocities as had occurred in Bulgaria twenty-eight years
previously. Nor did the burning of hundreds of villages ruffle the
European statesmen. A conference of the powers was indeed called and an
attempt made to institute such reforms as had been contemplated by the
XXIII Article of the Berlin Treaty, which included foreign police
officers, in command of the Turkish police in Macedonia. Each of the
powers did indeed send some officers down there, but they had little
more influence than so many tourists. After the uprising the same old
situation continued. The Greek Church was now making desperate attempts
to overrun Macedonia with its terrorist bands and Ferdinand started
another intrigue on behalf of Bulgarian propaganda which came near
proving more fatal to the committee than any of the Greek attacks.</p>

<p>Ferdinand, through a young Macedonian who had been an officer in his
army and was now an active member of the committee, Boris Sarafoff,
began a propaganda of bribery within the organization itself. By this
means he hoped to work up a majority within the committee in favor of
annexation with Bulgaria.</p>

<p>At this juncture Yani Sandanski reappeared on the scene. Grueff had
recently been killed in a skirmish with soldiers. Sandanski sent one of
his men down into Sofia, where Sarafoff was conferring with Ferdinand at
the time, and had him shot <span class="pagenum"><a id="page243" name="page243"></a>(p. 243)</span> down in the streets of the capital.
At the same time he sent an open message to Ferdinand, warning the
prince that if he continued his interference in Macedonia's internal
affairs, he would share the fate of Sarafoff. That ended Ferdinand's
second intrigue in Macedonia. Sandanski, who was now the recognized
leader of the Macedonian organization, was of course outlawed in
Bulgaria. But the time was presently to come when Ferdinand would seek
his friendship most humbly.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that the Macedo-Slovenes, though they formed an
overpowering majority in the membership of the committee, were the only
ones who were discontented with the rule of Abdul Hamid. The Vlachs of
Macedonia stood solidly beside the Macedo-Slovenes. In the beginning
some Greeks, too, had joined, but as the Greek Church excommunicated all
who enrolled under the banner of the committee, and, moreover, as
excommunication meant certain assassination, those few Greeks who really
felt sympathy for the cause of a free Macedonia found it expedient to
remain quiet.</p>

<p>The Mohammedans, however, though they did belong to the ruling race and
had more reason to hold aloof than the Greeks, were by no means solidly
against the committee. Whole communities of them, too, joined, or at
least offered shelter and comfort to the armed bands of the committee.
The Albanians especially were sympathetic, and great numbers of them
were active in the work.</p>

<p>But the discontent of the Turks with the Government was more fully
represented in a movement of separate origin. Young Turkish men had been
going abroad to study in foreign universities for a generation past and
had begun imbibing advanced ideas. They returned and began spreading
those ideas among their followers at home. Finally they too organized,
and this was the beginning of the Young Turk party.</p>

<p>The Young Turks had aims that differed very little from those of the
committee. They wanted a constitutional Turkey, under which all the
subjects of the sultan should be allowed to enjoy equal rights,
regardless of creed or race. Many of them were, in fact, in favor of a
republic. It was not long before their <span class="pagenum"><a id="page244" name="page244"></a>(p. 244)</span> leaders came in contact
with the leaders of the committee. And for some years they worked
quietly together. The Young Turks, it should be remembered, were
especially active in the army.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>




<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class="title">CRISIS IN TURKEY</p>


<p>Then, suddenly, in 1908, occurred what was probably the most alarming
event that had yet happened, from the point of view of Austria and
Russia. The sultan had decided to begin taking more severe measures with
the Young Turks, with the result that he precipitated a crisis. Enver
Bey and Niazi Bey, two of the Young Turk leaders, openly revolted in
Monastir and took to the near-by mountains, calling on all Turkish
subjects to support them. The revolt spread rapidly. The Young Turks
captured the city of Monastir and then the garrison at Saloniki handed
that city over to them. The sultan, seeing that the whole army was
against him, suddenly decided to temporize and finally agreed to
proclaim a constitution for Turkey.</p>

<p>In November of 1908 elections were held for the new Parliament and all
the various nationalities were given an opportunity to send in their
deputies.</p>

<p>But Abdul Hamid was not going to accept the new régime without another
effort to regain his old control. The following winter, after the
Parliament had met, he gathered together his old supporters and, having
made sure that he could count on the loyalty of the garrison in
Constantinople, suddenly abolished all that he had proclaimed and
declared the old régime restored.</p>

<p>Then Mahmud Shevket Pasha, the military leader of the Young Turks,
established himself in Macedonia and called on all the people to support
him.</p>

<p>The events which followed will ever rank as among the most dramatic and
picturesque of recent Turkish history. First of all the fighting bands
of the committee, which had already laid <span class="pagenum"><a id="page245" name="page245"></a>(p. 245)</span> down their arms,
reorganized again and came down from the mountains to join Shevket's
army. At their head marched Yani Sandanski, the leader of the committee
and the hated enemy of Prince Ferdinand. The comitajis, however, were
not the only ones to respond. When Shevket finally began to march on the
capital, he had in his army whole brigades of Greeks, Jews, Vlachs as
well as Turks and Bulgars.</p>

<p>When this army finally appeared outside the gates of Constantinople, the
sultan and his soldiers realized that all was lost, but it was now too
late to temporize again. A large force was sent in to disarm the
garrison and to drag Abdul Hamid off his throne. And at the very head of
that force, together with a hundred of his best men, marched Yani
Sandanski, the abductor of Miss Stone, the slayer of Prince Ferdinand's
chief conspirator in Macedonia, Boris Sarafoff, the brigand chief who
represented the people of Macedonia, but had been outlawed in every
Balkan State. What could be more symbolical of the partnership between
the Macedonia Committee and Young Turkey than that Yani Sandanski should
be one of those who were to drag Abdul Hamid off his throne and send him
a prisoner to Saloniki?</p>

<p>At that moment, and for some months after, it looked indeed as though
this union of previously antagonistic elements in European Turkey would
effectually balk all the intrigues, not only of the little Balkan
States, but of Austria and Russia as well. Nothing could have been more
disappointing to the tribe of diplomats than this unexpected turn of
events.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly most of the Young Turk leaders were sincere and really
wished to establish a new Ottoman Empire based on a broad citizenship of
all its peoples and the elimination of religious and racial differences
from politics. Many of them were out-and-out Socialists, as was Yani
Sandanski himself, who saw far-off visions of a great European, if not a
world, confederation which should banish war entirely from the earth.</p>

<p>But unfortunately Young Turkey had a bigger task on its hands than it
could swing. The Mohammedans of Macedonia and Thrace had been won over
to its progressive ideas. But the people of Islam on the other side of
the Bosphorus had yet <span class="pagenum"><a id="page246" name="page246"></a>(p. 246)</span> to be heard from. And when they did make
their voices heard, it was not in favor of recognizing the giaours as
their political equals.</p>

<p>Perhaps, even, if left to itself, Turkey, under the guidance of the new
and younger elements, might eventually have emerged triumphant against
the dark forces of fanaticism and reaction. But it was not to have that
opportunity. The solidarity of all the Turkish subjects, especially in
European Turkey, would be nothing less than a calamity to all the Balkan
States. There would be no "oppressed" brothers to rescue, consequently
no pretext for that territorial expansion which they had all counted on
to take place some day in the future. There could be no Greater Hellas,
a Byzantine Empire reestablished, with Constantinople as its capital;
there could be no Greater Bulgaria, with Czar Ferdinand as its ruler.
Russia, too, when her opportunity came to take Constantinople, would
come, not as a liberator of the Macedonian Slavs, but as an invading
enemy. And Austria would find her pathway to Saloniki blocked by a
stronger Turkey than she had counted upon. All these powers were against
the success of Young Turkey. But they did not stand shoulder to shoulder
against it. Between the Balkan States and the two big powers was another
division of interest quite as deep. It was the rivalry of the wolves and
the bears.</p>

<p>The Young Turks' revolution may definitely be considered the first jar
to the <i>status quo</i>, as established by the Treaty of Berlin, to be
followed in quick succession by other similar shocks, which were
presently to culminate in its complete upset and the present war. Turkey
herself had broken the compact to remain quiescent, to stand pat. With
the exception of the union of Eastern Rumelia with Bulgaria, there had
been no changes during those twenty-nine years.</p>

<p>The next event in the chain happened almost immediately. Hardly had the
revolution in Turkey occurred when Austria, who had, by the terms of the
Berlin Treaty, been simply administrating the two provinces of Bosnia
and Herzegovina, annexed them without any ceremony. In actual fact this
was merely making theory conform to the practical situation, but it put
the Young <span class="pagenum"><a id="page247" name="page247"></a>(p. 247)</span> Turks in an awkward predicament. The old régime
under Abdul Hamid would not have been able to do more than accept, and
that was what the Young Turks were compelled to do, handicapped as they
were by the confusion attending their own affairs at home. But it roused
the anger of the conservative Turks, and they somehow attributed it to
the new régime.</p>

<p>And at almost the same moment, as though to increase the irritation,
Prince Ferdinand kicked over another theory&mdash;that his principality was
under the suzerainty of the sultan&mdash;and declared himself king, or as he
called himself, czar of the independent kingdom of the Bulgars and of
all Bulgars elsewhere. Practically it meant nothing more than that he
was making faces at the new régime in Turkey, but it served the purpose
of irritating the masses of Islam.</p>

<p>But if the act of Austria in annexing Bosnia and Herzegovina irritated
the Turks, it almost maddened the Serbians, who had no cards to play in
this little game of diplomacy just at that moment. Serbia, like all her
neighbors, had her dreams of empire; she aspired not only to the
possession of Macedonia, but to the provinces of Bosnia and Herzegovina
as well, because of Serb population. Their annexation by Austria meant
to Serbia that there could now be no rearrangement. And it meant, too,
that Austria was still determined to work her way south, down to
Saloniki, when time and opportunity were ripe. It was, in fact, as much
of a threat to Serbia as to the Turks.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Young Turks continued with their attempt to establish
democracy in Constantinople. During the winter of 1908-9 the first
Parliament met. And naturally, the deputies representing the backward
and fanatical Mussulmans of Asia were in the majority, so that in the
very beginning it became obvious that democracy itself was going to
defeat its own ends. The reactionary elements, being in a majority in
the empire as a whole, it was only natural that their representatives in
the Parliament should be in a majority.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1910 there was a violent uprising of the more fanatical
Albanian tribes, who resisted the efforts of the new Government to
disarm the whole of the population, which was <span class="pagenum"><a id="page248" name="page248"></a>(p. 248)</span> undertaken as a
first step toward establishing that law and order which had never yet
been known in the empire and which the committee had organized to
establish, within the limits of its own communities, at least. The
schools, too, were taken out of the hands of the priests of the
respective peoples and put under the control of a Ministry of Education,
and this roused bitter resentment on the part of the Greeks, who, unlike
the Serbs and Bulgars, are under the complete domination of their
church.</p>

<p>Under the influence of the reactionary elements that had gained majority
control through the Parliament, the old repressive measures began
gradually to be reestablished. To Sandanski and his colleagues it soon
became evident that their fond hopes of a truly democratic Turkish
Empire was not to be realized. It was not under a constitutional Turkey
that the Macedonians would be accorded civic justice; that could only be
accomplished through a Macedonia enjoying home rule, whether as an
independent state or under the mere suzerainty of the sultan. This was
the state of mind toward which the Macedonians were tending when the
next serious event began developing.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>




<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p class="title">FORMATION OF THE BALKAN LEAGUE</p>


<p>Even to a school child it must have been obvious all along that the
solution of the whole Balkan trouble, from an internal point of view, at
least, lay in a union of all the peoples and the establishment of one
great nation, or federation of nations. Such a power, capable of putting
two million soldiers into the field, would not only be able to push the
Turk out of Europe, but it would be such an obstacle to the aggressive
ambitions of Russia and Austria that either would think twice before
attempting to overcome it by force.</p>

<p>This solution had been suggested at various times by various Balkan
statesmen during the past twenty years, statesmen with <span class="pagenum"><a id="page249" name="page249"></a>(p. 249)</span> broader
visions than most of their colleagues. Stambuloff had been one of them.
But such a union, or confederation, while it might prove of great
benefit to the general population, would mean a complete end to the
ambitions indulged in by the various Balkan monarchs and their cliques.
Each hoped to build a great empire which should include all the rest as
inferior possessions. Thus their selfish ambitions stood in the way of
the only feasible plan for a true remedy for the political ills of the
people.</p>

<p>But the new régime in Turkey seemed likely to put an end to their
imperial ambitions anyhow. The Young Turks were spending huge amounts of
money in equipping their army with modern guns and the admission of
Christians into the army was increasing its size too. Within a few years
Turkey would be in such a state of preparedness, from a military point
of view, as to make the task of driving her out of Europe forever
impossible. For each state had been building up its army for years past
with this ultimate end in view.</p>

<p>The time had come to act. It was now or never. The Balkan States must
bury their mutual jealousies, temporarily at least, and form a temporary
alliance with the object of defeating the Turks before it should be too
late. For the time being the spoils could be divided equally. Later on
each might find an opportunity to force rearrangements. Such an alliance
might temporarily suspend, but it would not end, the individual
ambitions of each governing clique. The idea may not have presented
itself so cynically to the man who first conceived it, but that was the
spirit in which it was later on acceded to by the Governments of the
states concerned.</p>

<p>It seems now to be generally conceded that it was the Prime Minister of
Greece, Eleutheorios Venizelos, to whom the credit belongs for having
initiated this new move. Of all the Balkan statesmen, not omitting the
monarchs, Venizelos stands out prominently not only as the most able,
but as being by far the most liberal and as possessed of the broadest
vision. Toleration has been the keynote to all his utterances and
actions. He seems to have been the one man of them all who, without
ceasing to be a Greek, has been able to rise above the atmosphere of
petty <span class="pagenum"><a id="page250" name="page250"></a>(p. 250)</span> jealousy, greed, and hatred that pervades the politics
of the Balkan States, especially in their mutual relations.</p>

<p>Though Italian by blood extraction, descendant of the old Dukes of
Athens, Venizelos is a Cretan by birth. Beginning his public career in
his native island as a "brigand" insurgent against Turkish power, he
finally became the leader of his people, being Prime Minister of the
Cretan Government in 1909.</p>

<p>In that year, shortly after the revolution of the Young Turks, there had
also been a revolution in Greece, though not of so progressive a
character. The "Military League," composed of the army officers, had
been organized and began to institute certain reforms that should end
the corruption and inefficiency that had been characteristic of Greek
politics. The members of the league being military men, were also modest
enough to realize their unfitness to undertake the task unaided, so they
called upon Venizelos to take charge, he being then the cleanest Greek
in politics. This task he assumed, as prime minister, with such ability
and effectiveness that he at once became the most popular man in Greece.
Among other things he undertook a complete reorganization of the army
under the supervision of foreign officers.</p>

<p>In April of 1911 Venizelos, through a British journalist, sent an
unofficial note to the Bulgarian Government suggesting an alliance
against Turkey. Five months later negotiations were also commenced with
Serbia, where a Serbo-Bulgarian alliance was suggested. But for a while
nothing definite was done, until suddenly the bigger powers began
showing signs of action. Italy, the ally of Austria, declared war on
Turkey in September, 1911, with the avowed purpose of possessing herself
of Tripoli.</p>

<p>This hurried the Balkan States. In March, 1912, Serbia and Bulgaria
signed a treaty of alliance. In April Greece and Bulgaria signed a
similar treaty, and a fortnight later Serbia and Greece signed another
document which made the Balkan League complete, Montenegro acting in
agreement with Serbia.</p>

<p>According to the Serbo-Bulgarian agreement, should the Turks be
defeated, Bulgaria was to take the whole of the territory south and east
of the Rhodope Mountains and the Struma River, while Serbia was to take
that north of the Shar Mountains, including <span class="pagenum"><a id="page251" name="page251"></a>(p. 251)</span> Old Serbia and
Kossovo. The rest, comprising all of Macedonia, was to be established as
an independent state. Should this, for any reason, be impossible, a line
was to be drawn from the point at which the Bulgarian, Serbian, and
Turkish frontiers met, a little northwest of Kustendil, to Struga at the
north end of Lake Ochrida, leaving Kratovo, Veles, Monastir, and Ochrida
to Bulgaria, all purely Slav districts, while the Czar of Russia was to
act as arbitrator with regard to the rest of the region, including
Kumanovo, Uskub, Krushevo, and Dibra. To this was added a clause by
which Bulgaria agreed to send 200,000 men to the support of Serbia
should Austria threaten her.</p>

<p>The agreement with Greece did not definitely provide for her share, but
it was understood she should have Epirus in southern Albania, Crete,
what islands in the Ægean her naval forces might capture, and a slice of
the Ægean seacoast where the population was mostly Greek. Montenegro was
to have what she could take from the Turkish forces in her vicinity.
Albania was not mentioned, but it was understood that Serbia was to
obtain her outlet on the Adriatic.</p>

<p>The clause in the agreement between Serbia and Bulgaria, providing for
an independent Macedonia, is especially significant. It was inserted for
the special consideration of Sandanski and the other Macedonian
committee leaders.</p>

<p>Shortly after the committee had made common cause with the Young Turks,
an attempt had been made to assassinate Sandanski in Saloniki. And
although it did not succeed, the attempt did not serve to warm the
hearts of the Macedonians toward King Ferdinand. None but he could have
had any interest in Sandanski's death at that time.</p>

<p>But by the summer of 1912 the Macedonians were pretty well disillusioned
regarding a constitutional Turkey. Many of the old leaders had taken to
the hills again, determined to take up the old fight where they had left
off. Even that fight seemed more hopeless than ever, for the Turkish
army was now being speedily reorganized and rendered more effective,
which meant that the pursuit of the guerrilla bands would be more deadly
than it had ever been under the old régime.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page252" name="page252"></a>(p. 252)</span> How the knowledge of the clause providing for an independent
Macedonia was conveyed to them is not recorded, but that Sandanski and
his colleagues were approached by the Bulgarian agents cannot be
doubted. Certain it is that just before hostilities broke out the blood
feud between Ferdinand and Sandanski had been put aside, and Sandanski,
the slayer of Sarafoff, the outlawed bandit, walked through the streets
of Sofia unmolested. And when the war did actually break out, Sandanski
was leading some thousands of his Macedonian comitajis against the Turks
in the Razlog district, which he conquered and turned over to the
Bulgarian authorities when they came there to establish a civil
government.</p>

<p>The league, having been established, was now anxious to begin operations
as soon as possible, for the reason that beginning hostilities against
Turkey while she was still at war with Italy would put the latter in the
position of being their ally. But that was just a position in which
Italy, as an ally of Austria, did not wish to find herself. So when it
became evident that the Balkan league had been formed and meant to take
action, Italy and Turkey both hastened to arrange terms of peace, the
former to save herself from an awkward situation, the latter so that she
might give her full attention to the new danger.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>




<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p class="title">FIRST AND SECOND BALKAN WARS</p>


<p>The war finally broke out on September 30, 1912, precipitated by
Montenegro before the other members of the league were quite ready. The
wonderful victories of the Serbian and Bulgarian armies were the
surprise and wonder of the world at the time. The Bulgarians were
victorious at Lule Burges, and the Serbians at Kumanovo. The Greeks
advanced as far as Saloniki, while their fleet bottled up the ships of
the Turks in the Dardanelles. Finally the Bulgarians swept the Turks in
Thrace into <span class="pagenum"><a id="page253" name="page253"></a>(p. 253)</span> Constantinople and were battering down the gates
of the capital itself. The Serbians marched an army over the mountains
to Durazzo on the Adriatic, and the Montenegrins took Scutari. And by
the following spring Turkey was suing for peace, which was finally
brought about by the Treaty of London on May 30, 1913.</p>

<p>But the very success of the Balkan allies opened up new dangers of deep
gravity. And now Austria, who had not quite dared to attack Serbia
during the hostilities, saw an opportunity whereby she might defeat the
league by opening up the dangers engendered by their very success. Had
it not been for her intrigues there would have been no Second Balkan
War. But she hated Serbia and was already determined on her destruction.</p>

<p>Largely because of the determined stand taken by Austria in the London
conference, Albania was made an independent principality, Serbia was
denied her longed-for outlet on the Adriatic, Greece was deprived of
Epirus, and Montenegro had to give up Scutari, the taking of which cost
her so much blood.</p>

<p>Now it had also happened that the operations of the various armies of
the Balkan allies had been in territories different from what had at
first been anticipated. The Turks had put up their main fight down in
Thrace, leaving the greater area of Macedonia comparatively undefended.
Thus the Bulgarians, while doing the heaviest fighting, had been
concentrated in a small territory, hammering away at the main forces of
the Turks, while the Serbian and Greek armies had been able to overrun
much larger territories with comparative ease. Thus Bulgaria, though she
had done most of the fighting and had lost the heaviest, occupied only a
broad pathway from her own southern frontier, down through Thrace to
Constantinople, while Serbia occupied most of Macedonia, and Greece was
in possession of Saloniki.</p>

<p>Greece and Serbia, and especially Serbia, having been cheated of most of
the territory they had counted on annexing by the Treaty of London, now
demanded a revision of the treaties by which they had gone into the war.
Moreover, the Treaty of London confirmed them in the possession of the
territory they now occupied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page255" name="page255"></a>(p. 255)</span> The bitterest feelings were at once rekindled. Both sides had
grievances. Serbia maintained that at the conference in London Bulgaria
had failed to back up her claim for Albania. Therefore she was entitled
to compensation in Macedonia. Bulgaria asserted that Macedonia was
inhabited by Bulgars who did not wish to become Serbian subjects.</p>

<p>Balkans After the Second Balkan War.</p></div>

<p>At this juncture Austria again appeared on the scene and whispered in
Bulgaria's ear that she should take what she wanted by force of arms;
was not her army equal to the armies of Greece and Serbia combined?
Meanwhile she, Austria, would see that there was no intervention from
the outside. This was one motive that drove Bulgaria into the Second
Balkan War.</p>

<p>For the past generation Macedonian boys had been coming up into
Bulgaria. Many had gone back to Macedonia, but the majority had remained
and settled in Bulgaria. Hundreds of them had entered the army and many
of them had acquired high rank. Others, again, had entered the
Government service, and dozens had been sent to the National Assembly by
Bulgarian constituencies. And several, among them Ghenadieff, had become
ministers in the cabinet.</p>

<p>To a still greater extent Macedonians have poured into Serbia. During
the past hundred years, ever since the pashalic of Belgrade became free
from the Turks, thousands of Macedonians have come up into Serbia for
education and a life. They entered the army, Parliament, and every
department of state, in large numbers, they became educationalists and
swelled the ranks of commerce. Among the members of the Serb Cabinet
during this war born in Macedonia are: the Prime Minister Nikola
Pashich, from Tetovo; Dr. Lazar Patchou, Minister of Finance, from
Monastir; Nicola Stefanovich, Cabinet Minister at the war's outbreak,
from Navrovo; Kosta Stoyanovich, former Minister of Commerce, from
Monastir; General Dimitriye Tzintzar-Markovich, from Ochrida; General
Lazar Lazarevich, from Moskopolye, Monastir; former Prime Minister Milan
Christich, the Serb Minister Plenipotentiary in Rome; Michael Ristich;
former Prime Minister Dr. Vladam Georgevich; Svetolick Popovich, from
Uskub; Under-Secretary of State for Public Works, Petar Popovich,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page256" name="page256"></a>(p. 256)</span> from Prilep; Head of Public Works, Professor Lazarevich, from
Ghevgheli; Professor Alexich, from Kumanovo; General Lazar Petrovich,
from Bashino Selo; Veles, and many others. The names of the
distinguished and prominent Macedonians in army, state, and education
services, and those in trade and other useful occupations in Serbia fill
a considerable space in the Post Office Directory.</p>

<p>The ambition of the Coburg King Ferdinand, since his coming to Bulgaria,
has steadily aimed at the conquest and annexation of neighboring
countries with the view of forming for himself an extended state. In
this idea Bulgaria has been developed by him on lines <i>de facto</i> tending
toward creating rather a feudal domain than a free, modern
constitutional state. He encouraged a large number of political parties
which could be easily played one against another, duplicating somewhat
the Hapsburg principle as applied in the Austrian system of
counterbalancing the various nationalities; the educational system was
not developed to the extent nor along lines to produce a truly free and
powerful people evidenced by the large number of young men and women
students finding it necessary to go for higher education to the American
Roberts College at Constantinople.</p>

<p>Ferdinand, always supported by Austria, with whom he has always been in
secret alliance, has devoted large sums to anti-Serb and anti-Greek
propaganda in Bulgaria, Macedonia, and throughout the world, preparing
for the day when his designs of conquest could be carried into effect.</p>

<p>As the First Balkan War drew to a finish, when King Ferdinand's grip had
hardly closed on the golden prize of that war, Adrianople, which the
Serbs helped their Bulgar brothers to conquer, and whose Turkish
commander and his staff, as fate decreed, were actually captured by the
Serbs and handed over by them to the Bulgarians, Ferdinand turned his
army westward to attack the Serbs, leaving Adrianople and Thracia, rich
territory which the Bulgars had just reconquered at such cost of blood
and which was confirmed to Bulgaria by the Treaty of London, to fall
back unprotected into the hands of the Turks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page257" name="page257"></a>(p. 257)</span> On the night of June 29, 1913, without any declaration of war,
the Bulgarian army suddenly attacked the Serbians and Greeks all along
the line, over 250 miles in length. Apparently General Savoff, the
Bulgarian commander, had taken the initiative upon himself, for all that
night and the next day the Government in Sofia kept sending telegrams
ordering the operations to cease.</p>

<p>All through July the fighting continued, and the battles were far more
bloody than those that had been fought with the Turks in the first war.
In the south the Bulgarians were decidedly beaten, but this was because
they had counted on holding the Greeks back with only 70,000 men.</p>

<p>The main fighting was on the Bregalnitza River, between the Serbians and
the Bulgarians. Here the Bulgarians also suffered a reverse. And the
Serbians were suffering losses that they could less afford than the
Bulgarians. Whether the Bulgarians might eventually have won out, as
their lines were contracted and the Greeks were drawn away from their
base at Saloniki, was a military question that was not to be decided.
For at this juncture Rumania took unexpected action. She suddenly on
July 10 began an invasion of Bulgaria from the north, and by the end of
the month her cavalry screens were within twenty miles of the Bulgarian
capital. The Turks, too, had recrossed the frontier and were once more
in possession of Adrianople, which the small Bulgarian garrison
surrendered without resistance. Literally the armies of all her
neighbors were invading Bulgaria. Further resistance was useless. On
July 31, after just one month of fighting, an armistice was signed, and
representatives from all the belligerents met in Bucharest to negotiate
terms of peace. On August 10 the Treaty of Bucharest was finally signed.</p>

<p>As a result of the Second Balkan War Bulgaria was left in a much worse
position than she was in after the first war. First of all she had to
give a slice of her Danubian territory to Rumania, as her price for
entering the war. Then she had to return part of Thrace, including
Adrianople, to the Turks. Serbia retained southeastern Macedonia, and
Greece kept Saloniki and its hinterland for fifty miles inward,
including Kavala, the natural economic outlet for Bulgaria on the Ægean.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>






<h2><span class="pagenum"><a id="page258" name="page258"></a>(p. 258)</span> PART III&mdash;DIRECT CAUSES OF THE WAR</h2>




<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p class="title">ASSASSINATION OF FRANZ FERDINAND&mdash;AUSTRIA'S ULTIMATUM</p>


<p>It was the boast of the greater European powers, during the Balkan Wars
of 1912 and 1913, and after, that the "conflagration in the Balkans had
been localized"&mdash;i.e., that none of the western nations would be
involved in the complications growing out of the trouble in the Balkans.
The conflagration in the mountainous peninsula had been "localized," it
was true; but the smouldering fire that remained after the Balkan Wars
was to flare forth, during the summer of 1914, to spread over Europe
from the Shetland Islands to Crete in one grand flame, and to drop
sparks on the remaining four continents. That smouldering fire was the
doctrine known as Greater Serbianism, sometimes wrongly spoken of as
Pan-Serbianism.</p>

<p>As during the nineteenth century one after another the Balkan States
gained independence from Turkish sovereignty and the germ of what is
called Nationalism was born in them, each looked about to see in what
direction its boundaries might be extended. The appetite of Nationalism,
with these small states as with the greater countries, demanded that
under the flag of a given nation must be gathered all the peoples of
that nation; if some of them dwell in foreign lands those lands must be
conquered; if foreigners live within the borders of the country those
foreigners must be "ironed out"&mdash;the crushing machinery of despotic
government must be brought into use to force them to adopt the language,
literature, traditions, and religion of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page259" name="page259"></a>(p. 259)</span> nation which
considered them alien. And the appetite of Nationalism demanded one
thing more&mdash;that the political boundaries of a nation conform with the
"natural boundaries" as they seemed to be delimited by mountains,
rivers, and coasts.</p>

<p>The kingdoms of Serbia and Montenegro had shown symptoms of Nationalism
long before the Balkan Wars of 1912 and 1913; when they emerged from
those wars with their territories almost doubled the idea took even
greater hold on them. As Turkish sovereignty and influence became less
feared, Austrian dominance replaced them.</p>

<p>Austria did nothing to allay this fear; she stood as a Teutonic bulwark
between a growing Slavic menace (in Serbia and Montenegro) on the south
and the already formidable Slavic menace (Russia) on the east. In her
provinces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which were transformed from
protectorates to integral parts of the Austrian Empire in 1908, there
dwelt thousands of peasants who were of Serbian nationality; in more
concise terms they were of the same racial stock as the Serbians. After
Serbian prestige rose as a result of the Balkan Wars of 1912 and 1913
these Serbian subjects of Austria desired more than ever to be a part of
the Slav kingdom; this desire was shared by the leading factions in
Serbia itself; the doctrine of "Greater Serbia" demanded that the aims
of the desire be materialized. Besides, the "natural boundaries" of
Serbia seemed to take in the greater part, if not all, of Bosnia and
Herzegovina, for they stretched along the eastern shores of the Adriatic
and shut Serbia and Montenegro off from that sea.</p>

<p>Propaganda began to spread throughout Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina,
reminding the Serbs in all three places that they must work to bring
themselves under one government, and that government their own; they
were urged to keep up their efforts to standardize their religion, their
speech, their traditions; they were called upon, by this same
propaganda, to substitute Austria for Turkey as the object of national
Serbian hate.</p>

<p>But Austria, too, had the disease of Nationalism, and she had been
engaged since 1908 in "ironing out" the Serbs within her borders. Thus
great friction was engendered, and when, on <span class="pagenum"><a id="page260" name="page260"></a>(p. 260)</span> June 28, 1914, the
Archduke Francis Ferdinand, the crown prince and his morganatic wife
visited the Bosnian city of Sarajevo, they and the officials of the city
and province knew that the lives of the pair were in danger from Serbian
intrigue.</p>

<p>The archduke had gone to Bosnia on his first visit to take charge of
military maneuvers there, and before he left the Austrian capital the
Serbian minister had expressed doubt as to the wisdom of the visit,
telling the court that the Serbian population in Bosnia might make
unfavorable demonstrations. The fears of the Serbian minister proved to
be well founded; Sarajevo displayed many Serbian flags on the day of his
arrival. The archduke's party, in automobiles, proceeded to the Town
Hall after leaving the railway station, passing through crowded streets.
The city officials were gathered at the Town Hall to give him an
official welcome. A bomb, hurled from a roof, fell into the archduke's
car; he caught it and threw it to the pavement, where it exploded, doing
no damage to either him or his wife, but injuring two adjutants in the
car following. One Gabrinovics, a Serbian from Trebinje, was arrested as
the assailant.</p>

<p>The archduke proceeded to the Town Hall, and after berating the city
officials listened to the speeches of welcome. As he and his wife were
departing a Serbian student, named Prinzip, who was later arrested,
rushed out from the crowd and fired point-blank at the couple with a
revolver. Both were hit a number of times and died some hours later from
their wounds.</p>

<p>Great excitement immediately prevailed in Sofia and Vienna, and in
Berlin and St. Petersburg to a lesser degree. What retribution would
Austria demand? The Austrian press openly avowed that the plot on the
archduke's life had been hatched in official circles in Serbia, and the
Austrian Government made no attempt to suppress these statements. One
hour after the tragedy had taken place it had assumed an official and
international complexion.</p>

<p>A punitive war against Serbia was immediately urged in Vienna. On June
29, 1914, anti-Serbian riots broke out in Bosnia, Sarajevo was put under
martial law, and the bodies of the assassinated couple began the
mournful journey to Vienna. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page261" name="page261"></a>(p. 261)</span> On July 2, 1914, Prinzip confessed
that he had apprised the Pan-Serbian Union of his attempt to kill the
archduke, and on the same day the first intimation came that the matter
was considered a serious one in Germany&mdash;the kaiser became
"diplomatically ill." Then, for twenty days there was an outward calm in
the capitals of Europe, but behind the scenes the diplomats were at
work; the great question was how far Russia would go in defending her
Slavic sister state against the impending demands of Austria.</p>

<p>These demands were made public in a note which Austria sent to Serbia on
July 23, 1914. Serbia was given till 6 p. m., July 25, 1914, to comply
with the ultimatum, which read as follows:</p>

<p>"On March 31, 1909, the Royal Serbian Minister in Vienna, on the
instructions of the Serbian Government, made the following statements to
the Imperial and Royal Government:</p>

<p>"'Serbia recognizes that the <i>fait accompli</i> regarding Bosnia has not
affected her rights, and consequently she will conform to the decisions
that the powers will take in conformity with Article XXV of the Treaty
of Berlin. At the same time that Serbia submits to the advice of the
powers she undertakes to renounce the attitude of protest and opposition
which she has adopted since October last. She undertakes on the other
hand to modify the direction of her policy with regard to
Austria-Hungary and to live in future on good neighborly terms with the
latter.'</p>

<p>"The history of recent years, and in particular the painful events on
June 28 last, have shown the existence in Serbia of subversive movement
with the object of detaching a part of Austria-Hungary from the
monarchy. The movement which had its birth under the eyes of the Serbian
Government, has had consequences on both sides of the Serbian frontier
in the shape of acts of terrorism and a series of outrages and murders.</p>

<p>"Far from carrying out the formal undertakings contained in the
declaration of March 31, 1909, the Royal Serbian Government has done
nothing to repress these movements. It has permitted the criminal
machinations of various societies and associations, and has tolerated
unrestrained language on the part of the press, apologies for the
perpetrators of outrage and the participation of officers and
functionaries in subversive agitation. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page262" name="page262"></a>(p. 262)</span> It has permitted an
unwholesome propaganda in public instruction. In short, it has permitted
all the manifestations which have incited the Serbian population to
hatred of the monarchy and contempt of its institutions.</p>

<p>"This culpable tolerance of the Royal Serbian Government had not ceased
at the moment when the events of June 28 last proved its fatal
consequences to the whole world.</p>

<p>"It results from the depositions and confessions of the criminal
perpetrators of the outrage of June 28 that the Sarajevo assassinations
were hatched in Belgrade, that the arms and explosives with which the
murderers were provided had been given to them by Serbian officers and
functionaries belonging to the Narodna Obrava, and, finally, that the
passage into Bosnia of the criminals and their arms was organized and
effected by the chiefs of the Serbian Frontier Service.</p>

<p>"The above-mentioned results of the magisterial investigation do not
permit the Austro-Hungarian Government to pursue any longer the attitude
of expectant forbearance which it has maintained for years in face of
the machinations hatched in Belgrade and thence propagated in the
territories of the monarchy. These results, on the contrary, impose on
it the duty of putting an end to intrigues which form a perpetual menace
to the tranquility of the monarchy.</p>

<p>"To achieve this end the Imperial and Royal Government sees itself
compelled to demand from the Serbian Government a formal assurance that
it condemns this dangerous propaganda against the monarchy and the
territories belonging to it, and that the Royal Serbian Government shall
no longer permit these machinations and this criminal and perverse
propaganda.</p>

<p>"In order to give a formal character to this undertaking the Royal
Serbian Government shall publish on the front page of its official
journal for July 26 the following declaration:</p>

<p>"'The Royal Government of Serbia condemns the propaganda directed
against Austria-Hungary, i. e., the ensemble of tendencies of which the
final aim is to detach from Austro-Hungarian monarchy territories
belonging to it, and it sincerely deplores the fatal consequences of
these criminal proceedings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page263" name="page263"></a>(p. 263)</span> "'The Royal Government regrets that Serbian officers and
functionaries participated in the above-mentioned propaganda and thus
compromised the good, neighborly relations to which the Royal Government
was solemnly pledged by its declaration of March 31, 1909. The Royal
Government, which disapproves and repudiates all idea of interfering or
attempt to interfere with the destinies of the inhabitants of any part
whatsoever of Austria-Hungary, considers it its duty formally to warn
officers and functionaries, and the whole population of the kingdom,
that henceforward it will proceed with the utmost rigor against persons
who may be guilty of such machinations, which it will use all its
efforts to anticipate and suppress.'</p>

<p>"The Royal Serbian Government further undertakes:</p>

<p>"1. To suppress any publications which incite to hatred and contempt of
the Austro-Hungarian monarchy and the general tendency of which is
directed against its territorial integrity.</p>

<p>"2. To dissolve immediately the society styled Narodna Obrava, to
confiscate all its means of propaganda, and to proceed in the same
manner against other societies and their branches which are addicted to
propaganda against the Austro-Hungarian monarchy. The Royal Government
shall take the necessary measures to prevent the societies dissolved
from continuing their activity under another name and form.</p>

<p>"3. To eliminate without delay from public instruction in Serbia, not
only as regards the teaching body, but also as regards the methods of
instruction, everything that serves or might serve to foment the
propaganda against Austria-Hungary.</p>

<p>"4. To remove from the military service and from the Administration in
general all officers and functionaries guilty of propaganda against the
Austro-Hungarian monarchy, whose names and deeds the Austro-Hungarian
Government reserves to itself the right of communicating to the Royal
Government.</p>

<p>"5. To accept the collaboration in Serbia of representatives of the
Austro-Hungarian Government in the suppression of the subversive
movement directed against the territorial integrity of the monarchy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page265" name="page265"></a>(p. 265)</span> "6. To take judicial proceedings against accessories to the
plot of June 28 who are on Serbian territory. Delegates of the
Austro-Hungarian Government will take part in the investigation relating
thereto.</p>

<p>"7. To proceed without delay to the arrest of Major Voija Tankositch and
of the individual named Milan Ciganovitch, a Serbian state employee, who
have been compromised by the results of the magisterial inquiry at
Sarajevo.</p>

<p>"8. To prevent by effective measures the cooperation of the Serbian
authorities in the illicit traffic in arms and explosives across the
frontier, and to dismiss and punish severely officials of the frontier
service at Schabatz and Loznica guilty of having assisted the
perpetrators of the Sarajevo crime by facilitating the passage of the
frontier for them.</p>

<p>"9. To furnish the Austro-Hungarian Government with explanations
regarding the unjustifiable utterances of high Serbian officials, both
in Serbia and abroad, who, notwithstanding their official position, did
not hesitate after the crime of June 28 to express themselves in
interviews in terms of hostility to the Austro-Hungarian Government, and
finally;</p>

<p>"10. To notify the Austro-Hungarian Government without delay of the
execution of the measures comprised under the preceding heads.</p>

<p>"The Austro-Hungarian Government expects the reply of the Serbian
Government at the latest by six o'clock on Saturday evening, July 26,
1914."<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>

<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<p class="title">SERBIA'S REPLY</p>


<p>Because this note was so specific in its demands it is best to give in
full the Serbian reply to it, which was issued within the period set by
the Austro-Hungarian note. The Serbian answer in full was as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page266" name="page266"></a>(p. 266)</span> "The Royal Serbian Government has received the communication of
the Imperial and Royal Austro-Hungarian Government, and it is persuaded
that its reply will remove all misunderstanding tending to threaten or
to prejudice the friendly and neighborly relations between the
Austro-Hungarian monarchy and the kingdom of Serbia.</p>

<p>"The Royal Government is aware that the protests made both at the
tribune of the National Skupshtina (the Serbian legislative body) and in
the declarations and the acts of responsible representatives of the
state&mdash;protests which were cut short by the declaration of the Serbian
Government made on March 18&mdash;have not been renewed toward the great
neighboring monarchy on any occasion and that since this time, both on
the part of the Royal Governments which have followed on one another,
and on the part of their organs, no attempt has been made with the
purpose of changing the political and judicial state of things in this
respect.</p>

<p>"The Imperial and Royal Government has made no representations save
concerning a scholastic book regarding which the Imperial and Royal
Government has received an entirely satisfactory explanation. Serbia has
repeatedly given proofs of her pacific and moderate policy during the
Balkan crises, and it is thanks to Serbia and the sacrifice she made
exclusively in the interest of the peace of Europe that this peace has
been preserved. The Royal Government cannot be held responsible for
manifestations of a private nature, such as newspaper articles and the
peaceful work of societies&mdash;manifestations which occur in almost all
countries as a matter of course, and which, as a general rule, escape
official control&mdash;all the less in that the Royal Government when solving
a whole series of questions which came up between Serbia and
Austria-Hungary has displayed a great readiness to treat prevenance, and
in this way succeeded in settling the greater number to the advantage of
the progress of the two neighboring countries.</p>

<p>"It is for this reason that the Royal Government has been painfully
surprised by the statements according to which persons of the Kingdom of
Serbia are said to have taken part in the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page267" name="page267"></a>(p. 267)</span> preparation of the
outrage committed at Sarajevo. It expected that it would be invited to
collaborate in the investigation of everything bearing on this crime,
and it was ready to prove by its actions its entire correctness to take
steps against all persons with regard to whom communications had been
made to it, thus acquiescing in the desire of the Imperial and Royal
Government.</p>

<p>"The Royal Government is disposed to hand over to the courts any Serbian
subject, without regard to his situation and rank, for whose complicity
in the crime of Sarajevo it shall have been furnished with proofs, and
especially it engages itself to have published on the front page of the
official journal of July 13-26 the following announcement:</p>

<p>"'The Royal Serbian Government condemns all propaganda directed against
Austria-Hungary, that is to say, all tendencies as a whole of which the
ultimate object is to detach from the Austro-Hungarian monarchy
territories which form part of it, and it sincerely deplores the fatal
consequences of these criminal actions. The Royal Government regrets
that Serbian officers and officials should, according to the
communication of the Imperial and Royal Government, have participated in
the above-mentioned propaganda, thereby compromising the good neighborly
relations to which the Royal Government solemnly pledged itself by its
declaration of March 31, 1909. The Government, which disapproves and
repudiates any idea or attempt to interfere in the destinies of the
inhabitants of any part of Austria-Hungary whatsoever, considers it its
duty to utter a formal warning to the officers, the officials, and the
whole population of the kingdom that henceforth it will proceed with the
utmost rigor against persons who render themselves guilty of such
actions, which it will use all its force to prevent and repress.'</p>

<p>"This announcement shall be brought to the cognizance of the Royal army
by an order of the day issued in the name of his Majesty the King by H.
R. H. the Crown Prince Alexander, and shall be published in the next
official bulletin of the army.</p>

<p>"1. The Royal Government engages itself, furthermore, to lay before the
next meeting of the Skupshtina an amendment to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page268" name="page268"></a>(p. 268)</span> the press law,
punishing in the severest manner incitements to hate and contempt of the
Austro-Hungarian monarchy, and also all publications of which the
general tendency is directed against the territorial integrity of the
monarchy. It undertakes at the forthcoming revision of the constitution
to introduce an amendment whereby the above publications may be
confiscated, which is at present forbidden by the terms of Article XXII
of the constitution.</p>

<p>"2. The Government does not possess any proof, nor does the note of the
Imperial and Royal Government furnish such, that the Society Narodna
Obrana and other similar societies have up to the present committed any
criminal acts of this kind through the instrumentality of one of their
members. Nevertheless, the Royal Government will accept the demand of
the Imperial and Royal Government and will dissolve the Narodna Obrana
Society and any other society which shall agitate against
Austria-Hungary.</p>

<p>"3. The Royal Serbian Government engages itself to eliminate without
delay for public instruction in Serbia everything which aids or might
aid in fomenting the propaganda against Austria-Hungary when the
Imperial and Royal Government furnishes facts and proofs of this
propaganda.</p>

<p>"4. The Royal Government also agrees to remove from the military service
(all persons) whom the judicial inquiry proves to have been guilty of
acts directed against the integrity of the territory of the
Austro-Hungarian monarchy, and it expects the Imperial and Royal
Government to communicate at an ulterior date the names and the deeds of
these officers and officials for the purposes of the proceedings which
will have to be taken.</p>

<p>"5. The Royal Government must confess that it is not quite clear as to
the sense and object of the demands of the Imperial and Royal Government
that Serbia should undertake to accept on her territory the
collaboration of delegates of the Imperial and Royal Government, but it
declares that it will admit whatever collaboration which may be in
accord with the principles of international law and criminal procedure,
as well as with good neighborly relations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page269" name="page269"></a>(p. 269)</span> "6. The Royal Government, as goes without saying, considers it
to be its duty to open an inquiry against all those who are, or shall
eventually prove to have been, involved in the plot of June 28, and who
are in Serbian territory. As to the participation at this investigation
of agents of the Austro-Hungarian authorities delegated for this purpose
by the Imperial and Royal Government, the Royal Government cannot accept
this demand, for it would be a violation of the constitution and of the
law of criminal procedure. Nevertheless, in concrete cases it might be
found possible to communicate the results of the investigation in
question to the Austro-Hungarian representatives.</p>

<p>"7. On the very evening that the note was handed in the Royal Government
arrested Major Voija Tankositch. As for Milan Ciganovitch, who is a
subject of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, and who until June 15 was
employed as a beginner in the administration of the railways, it has not
yet been possible to (arrest) him. In view of the ultimate inquiry the
Imperial and Royal Government is requested to have the goodness to
communicate in the usual form as soon as possible the presumptions of
guilt, as well as the eventual proofs of guilt, against these persons
which have been collected up to the present in the investigations at
Sarajevo.</p>

<p>"8. The Serbian Government will strengthen and extend the measures taken
to prevent the illicit traffic of arms and explosives across the
frontier. It goes without saying that it will immediately order an
investigation and will severely punish the frontier officials along the
line Schabatz-Losnitza who have been lacking in their duties and who
allowed the authors of the crime of Sarajevo to pass.</p>

<p>"9. The Royal Government will willingly give explanations regarding the
remarks made in interviews by its officials, both in Serbia and abroad,
after the attempt, and which, according to the statement of the Imperial
and Royal Government, were hostile toward the monarchy, as soon as the
Imperial and Royal Government has (forwarded) it the passages in
question of these remarks and as soon as it has shown that the remarks
made were <span class="pagenum"><a id="page270" name="page270"></a>(p. 270)</span> really made by the officials regarding whom the
Royal Government itself will see about collecting proofs.</p>

<p>"10. The Royal Government will inform the Imperial and Royal Government
of the execution of the measures comprised in the preceding points, in
so far as that has not already been done by the present note, as soon as
such measure has been ordered and executed.</p>

<p>"In the event of the Imperial and Royal Government considering that it
is to the common interest not to precipitate the solution of this
question, it is ready, as always, to accept a pacific understanding,
either by referring this question to the decision of The Hague
International Tribunal or to the great powers which took part in the
drawing up of the declaration made by the Serbian Government on March
18-31, 1909."<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>




<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<p class="title">DIPLOMATIC EXCHANGES</p>


<p>This reply from Serbia was not deemed satisfactory by Austria-Hungary
and relations with Serbia were immediately broken off. On the following
day, July 26, 1914, "diplomatic conversations," the object of which was
to smooth over the differences between Austria-Hungary and Serbia, took
place in Berlin, St. Petersburg and Vienna between representatives of
the three nations whose capitals these were.</p>

<p>Austria-Hungary sent to the various governments the following "circular
note" on July 27, 1914:</p>

<p>"The object of the Serbian note is to create the false impression that
the Serbian Government is prepared in great measure to comply with our
demands.</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact, however, Serbia's note is filled with the spirit
of dishonesty, which clearly lets it be seen that the Serbian Government
is not seriously determined to put an end to the culpable tolerance it
hitherto has extended to intrigues against the Austro-Hungarian
monarchy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page271" name="page271"></a>(p. 271)</span> "The Serbian note contains such far-reaching reservations and
limitations not only regarding the general principles of our Action, but
also in regard to the individual claims we have put forward, that the
concessions actually made by Serbia become insignificant.</p>

<p>"In particular, our demand for the participation of the Austro-Hungarian
authorities in investigations to detect accomplices in the conspiracy on
Serbian territory has been rejected, while our request that measures be
taken against that section of the Serbian press hostile to
Austria-Hungary has been declined, and our wish that the Serbian
Government take the necessary measures to prevent the dissolved
Austrophobe associations continuing their activity under another name
and under another form has not even been considered.</p>

<p>"Since the claims in the Austro-Hungarian note of July 23, regard being
had to the attitude hitherto adopted by Serbia, represent the minimum of
what is necessary for the establishment of permanent peace with the
southeastern monarchy, the Serbian answer must be regarded as
unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>"That the Serbian Government itself is conscious that its note is not
acceptable to us is proved by the circumstances that it proposes at the
end of the note to submit the dispute to arbitration&mdash;an invitation
which is thrown into its proper light by the fact that three hours
before handing in the note, a few minutes before the expiration of the
time limit, the mobilization of the Serbian army took place."</p>

<p>The Great powers were not willing to go to war without first trying
mediation between the two kingdoms in southeastern Europe, and even
Russia, which was known to be a potential ally of Serbia, showed a
disposition to use diplomacy before force. When the demands made by
Austria-Hungary in her note of July 25, 1914, became known in the
Russian capital, the following note was immediately telegraphed to
Vienna:</p>

<p>"The communication [the circular note quoted above] made by
Austria-Hungary to the powers the day after the presentation of the
ultimatum at Belgrade leaves a period to the powers which is quite
insufficient to enable them to take any <span class="pagenum"><a id="page272" name="page272"></a>(p. 272)</span> steps which might help
to smooth away the difficulties that have arisen.</p>

<p>"In order to prevent the consequences, equally incalculable and fatal to
all the powers, which may result from the course of action followed by
the Austro-Hungarian Government, it seems to us to be above all
essential that the period allowed for the Serbian reply should be
extended. Austria-Hungary, having declared her readiness to inform the
powers of the results of the inquiry upon which the Imperial and Royal
Government base their accusations, should equally allow them sufficient
time to study them.</p>

<p>"In this case, if the powers were convinced that certain of the Austrian
demands were well founded, they would be in a position to offer advice
to the Serbian Government.</p>

<p>"A refusal to prolong the term of the ultimatum would render nugatory
the proposals made by the Austro-Hungarian Government to the powers, and
would be in contradiction to the very bases of international relations."</p>

<p>A copy of this note was at the same time sent to London with the
addenda: "M. Sazonoff (Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs) hopes that
his Britannic Majesty's Government will share the point of view set
forth above, and he trusts that Sir E. Grey will see his way to furnish
similar instructions to the British Ambassador at Vienna."</p>

<p>But on the same day, July 25, 1914, the Government at Vienna informed
the powers that the note to Serbia was not an ultimatum; it was merely a
démarche, and in it Austria had threatened to start military
preparations, not operations. The requested delay, therefore, was not
granted. That day was eventful in London, too, for the Foreign Office
was notified by the German Ambassador that though Germany had not been
apprised beforehand of the contents of Austria's note to Serbia, the
German nation would nevertheless stand by its ally. "The German
Ambassador read to me," said Sir Edward Grey in a telegram to the
British Ambassador at Vienna, "a telegram from the German Foreign Office
saying that his Government had not known beforehand, and had had no more
than other powers to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page273" name="page273"></a>(p. 273)</span> do with the stiff terms of the Austrian
note to Serbia, but that once she had launched the note, Austria could
not draw back." Prince Lichnowsky (German Ambassador at London) said,
however, that "if what I contemplated was mediation between Austria and
Russia, Austria might be able with dignity to accept it." He expressed
himself as personally favorable to this suggestion.</p>

<p>"I concurred in his observation, and said that I felt I had no title to
intervene between Austria and Serbia, but as soon as the question became
one as between Austria and Russia, the peace of Europe was affected, in
which we must all take a hand.</p>

<p>"I impressed upon the ambassador that, in the event of Russian and
Austrian mobilization, the participation of Germany would be essential
to any diplomatic peace. Alone we could do nothing. The German
Government agreed with my suggestion, to tell the French Government that
I thought it the right thing to act upon it."</p>

<p>On July 26, 1914, the Russian Ambassador at Berlin informed the German
Government that he was instructed to state that any annexation by
Austria-Hungary of Serbian territory would not be looked upon by Russia
with indifference. The German Emperor, who had been away from Berlin,
returned hastily to the capital. As the crisis approached the British
Government once more attempted to have the matters in dispute settled by
mediation. The following telegram was dispatched from Downing Street to
the British Ambassadors at Paris and Rome: "London, Foreign Office, July
26, 1914. Would Minister of Foreign Affairs be disposed to instruct
ambassador here to join with representatives of France, Italy, and
Germany, and myself to meet here in conference immediately for the
purpose of discovering an issue which would prevent complications? You
should ask the Minister of Foreign Affairs whether he would do this. If
so, when bringing the above suggestions to the notice of the Governments
to which they are accredited, representatives of Belgrade, Vienna, and
St. Petersburg, could be authorized to request that all active military
operations should be suspended pending results of the conference."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page274" name="page274"></a>(p. 274)</span> But this move had come too late. The British Ambassador to
Berlin reported by telegraph to his Government on July 27, 1914, that
the Imperial German Government considered that the proposed conference
amounted practically to a court of arbitration and could not be called
except at the behest of Austria-Hungary and Russia. The German
Government therefore turned down the British proposal. But Germany was
not for provoking a war; the German Ambassador at London informed the
British Foreign Office that his Government was willing to accept in
principle the mediation of the powers between Austria and Russia.</p>

<p>The question of whether the alliances between the various nations would
hold under a strain now became pointed. The Russian Government informed
the British Government on July 27, 1914, that the impression prevailed
in Berlin and Vienna that England would stand aloof under any
circumstances, differences between Russia and Austria notwithstanding.
But on the same day Sir Edward Grey, British Minister for Foreign
Affairs, dispelled these impressions in a telegram to the British
Ambassador at St. Petersburg. "The impression ought to be dispelled by
the orders we have given to the First Fleet," it read in part, "which is
concentrated, as it happens, at Portland, not to disperse for maneuver
leave." On July 28, 1914, the British Government was informed that
France and Russia were agreeable to having a conference called in
London; the Italian Government had already reported that it agreed to
this plan, but the refusal of Germany, mentioned above, rendered these
communications useless.</p>

<p>On July 28, 1914, the British Government was informed by telegram from
its Ambassador at Vienna that "Austria-Hungary cannot delay warlike
proceedings against Serbia, and would have to decline any suggestions of
negotiations on basis of Serbian reply.</p>

<p>"Prestige of Dual Monarchy was engaged, and nothing could now prevent
conflict." This telegram, be it noted, made use of the term "military
proceedings" instead of "military preparations" and therefore had the
effect of changing Austria-Hungary's <span class="pagenum"><a id="page275" name="page275"></a>(p. 275)</span> note to Serbia into an
ultimatum. Russia, on July 28, 1914, began to mobilize troops near
Odessa, Moscow, Kieff and Kazan, and on the following day this fact was
communicated officially to the Government at Berlin.</p>

<p>As Austria-Hungary and Russia were about to come to grips Germany made
it plain that she would stand by her ally, Austria-Hungary. In times of
peace there may have been doubt throughout Europe as to the strength of
the bonds of the Triple Entente, but the German Government was not
disposed to rely on these doubts when the critical moment came. The
British Ambassador at Berlin was asked to visit the German Chancellor
and as a result of this visit the former sent the following telegram to
the British Foreign Office:</p>

<p>"Berlin, July 29, 1914. I was asked to call upon the chancellor
to-night. His excellency had just returned from Potsdam.</p>

<p>"He said that should Austria be attacked by Russia a European
conflagration might, he feared, become inevitable, owing to Germany's
obligations as Austria's ally, in spite of his continued efforts to
maintain peace. He then proceeded to make the following strong bid for
British neutrality. He said that it was clear, so far as he was able to
judge the main principle which governed British policy, that Great
Britain would never stand by and allow France to be crushed in any
conflict there might be. That, however, was not the object at which
Germany aimed. Provided that neutrality of Great Britain were certain,
every assurance would be given to the British Government that the
Imperial Government aimed at no territorial acquisitions at the expense
of France should they prove victorious in any war that might ensue.</p>

<p>"I questioned his excellency about the French colonies, and he said that
he was unable to give a similar undertaking in that respect. As regards
Holland, however, his excellency said that, so long as Germany's
adversaries respected the integrity and neutrality of the Netherlands,
Germany was ready to give his Majesty's Government an assurance that she
would do likewise. It depended upon the action of France what operations
Germany might be forced to enter upon in Belgium, but when the war
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page276" name="page276"></a>(p. 276)</span> was over Belgian integrity would be respected if she had not
sided against Germany.</p>

<p>"His excellency ended by saying that ever since he had been chancellor
the object of his policy had been, as you were aware, to bring about an
understanding with England; he trusted that these assurances might form
the basis of that understanding which he so much desired. He had in mind
a general neutrality agreement between England and Germany, though it
was of course at the present moment too early to discuss details, and an
assurance of British neutrality in the conflict which the present crisis
might possibly produce would enable him to look forward to a realization
of his desire.</p>

<p>"In reply to his excellency's inquiry how I thought his request would
appeal to you, I said that I did not think it probable that at this
stage of events you would care to bind yourself to any course of action
and that I was of opinion that you would desire to retain full liberty."</p>

<p>Here for the first time the matter of Belgian neutrality entered into
the diplomatic discussions; the danger of a Pan-European conflict was
apparent, for the diplomats from then on were less concerned with the
Austro-Hungarian dispute with Serbia than with the possibilities that a
war in western Europe might entail. On the same day, July 29, 1914, the
German Ambassador at London was officially informed that if the European
crisis involved nothing more than disputes between Russia and Austria on
the one hand, and the military operations of Austria in Serbia on the
other, England would keep out of the trouble, but if Germany went to war
with Russia, or if France went to war, England could not stand quietly
aside. News had come that day that Austria had declared war on Serbia
the day before. The declaration read as follows:</p>

<p>"The Royal Government of Serbia, not having replied in a satisfactory
manner to the note remitted to it by the Austro-Hungarian Minister in
Belgrade on July 23, 1914, the Imperial and Royal Government finds
itself compelled to proceed to safeguard its rights and interests and to
have recourse for this purpose to force of arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page278" name="page278"></a>(p. 278)</span> "Austria-Hungary considers itself, therefore, from this moment
in a state of war with Serbia."</p>

<p>Poland and Its Divisions from 1772-1914.</p></div>

<p>At the same time the Government at Vienna issued this note to the
foreign ambassadors there with the request that they forward it to their
respective governments:</p>

<p>"In order to bring to an end the subversive intrigues originating from
Belgrade and aimed at the territorial integrity of the Austro-Hungarian
Monarchy, the Imperial and Royal Government has delivered to the Royal
Serbian Government a note in which a series of demands were formulated,
for the acceptance of which a delay of forty-eight hours has been
granted to the Royal Government. The Royal Serbian Government not having
answered this note in a satisfactory manner, the Imperial and Royal
Government are themselves compelled to see to the safeguarding of their
rights and interest, and with this object, to have recourse to force of
arms.</p>

<p>"Austria-Hungary, who has just addressed to Serbia a formal declaration,
in conformity with Article I of the convention of October 18, 1907,
relative to the opening of hostilities, considers itself in a state of
war with Serbia.</p>

<p>"In bringing the above notice to the powers, the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs has the honor to declare that Austria-Hungary will act during
the hostilities in conformity with the terms of the Conventions of the
Hague of October 18, 1907, as also with those of the Declaration of
London of February 28, 1909, provided an analogous procedure is adopted
by Serbia."</p>

<p>The great question as to what Russia would do was answered by a note
issued at St. Petersburg, July 28, 1914, which stated that Russia
wished, above all, to maintain peace. But the moments during which words
alone would be availing were fast passing. Austria-Hungary was
mobilizing her armies, and not all of the mobilization was on her
southern frontier; some corps were gathered at points from which a blow
from Russia might be warded off, or offensive move against Russia made.</p>

<p>On July 30, 1914, the German Government sent a short note to St.
Petersburg, in which three questions were asked. These were: the reason
for the Russian mobilization, which Berlin <span class="pagenum"><a id="page279" name="page279"></a>(p. 279)</span> knew to be in
progress; whether it was directed against Austria; and on what terms
Russia might be induced to demobilize.</p>

<p>The Czar, on July 31, 1914, sent a note to the German Emperor in which
he said in part: "... It is technically impossible to discontinue our
military operations, which have been rendered necessary by Austrian
mobilization. We are far from wishing for war, and so long as
negotiations with Austria regarding Serbia continue, my troops will not
undertake any provocative actions." This was an admission that Russian
general mobilization was in progress.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>




<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<p class="title">PREPARATION FOR WAR</p>


<p>As a matter of fact, during the last days of July, 1914, all the
Governments in Europe had their military departments busy on the problem
of preparing for the first blows in war; these included not only the six
leading powers, but also the Scandinavian countries, Spain, Portugal,
all the Balkan kingdoms, and Belgium and Holland. The diplomatic
exchanges that were meanwhile taking place were known to all experienced
statesmen to be hardly more than masks.</p>

<p>On August 1, 1914, the kaiser declared Germany to be "in a state of
war." This did not carry with it a declaration of war against any power,
but had the effect of putting the entire German Empire under martial
law, everything being in readiness to cope with an enemy. On the same
day the kaiser made an important speech in which he said, "A fateful
hour has fallen for Germany. Envious peoples everywhere are compelling
us to our just defense. The sword has been forced into our hands.</p>

<p>"I hope that if my efforts at the last hour do not succeed in inducing
our opponents to see eye to eye with us and in maintaining peace, we
shall, with God's help, so wield the sword that we shall restore it to
its sheath again with honor." On the same day, however&mdash;namely August 1,
1914, at five o'clock <span class="pagenum"><a id="page280" name="page280"></a>(p. 280)</span> in the evening he signed an order
mobilizing the German army, and Russia and Germany went to war two hours
later. A demand made upon the French Government by the German
Government, asking the intentions of France in case Russia went to war
with Germany, received an unsatisfactory reply on August 2, 1914, and
France on the same day mobilized its army, though it declared war on no
power. On August 3, 1914, German troops entered French territory, for
Germany did not wish to be delayed in a campaign in the west by waiting
for diplomatic exchanges to take place; war between Germany and France
began at the moment the foreign soldiers crossed into France.</p>

<p>It was, in theory at least, over the matter of Belgian neutrality that
England and Germany went to war. As soon the British Government saw that
hopes for peace were no longer possible Sir Edward Grey sent to its
ambassadors in Germany and France the following telegram; "London, July
31, 1914; I still trust situation is not irretrievable, but in view of
prospect of mobilization in Germany it becomes essential to his
Majesty's Government, in view of existing treaties, to ask whether
French [and German] Government is prepared to engage to respect the
neutrality of Belgium so long as no other power violates it. A similar
request is being addressed to the German [and French] Government. It is
important to have an early answer."</p>

<p>To this telegram the French Government, on August 1, 1914, answered that
it stood ready to respect Belgian neutrality provided no other power
threatened or violated it. Germany hesitated to give a definite reply
immediately for fear of disclosing the plans of campaign she had against
France.</p>

<p>On August 3, 1914, German troops moved into Luxemburg, en route for
France, and it was then known that a German invasion of Belgium would be
inevitable. But before taking this step Germany tendered certain
proposals to the Belgian Government, assuring it that if peaceful
passage were given to German troops Belgium would be given a subsidy.
But the Belgian Government turned down these proposals and the king sent
this telegram to the British monarch: "Remembering the numerous proofs
of your majesty's friendship and that of your predecessor, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page281" name="page281"></a>(p. 281)</span> of
the friendly attitude of England in 1870, and the proof of the
friendship which she has just given us again, I make a supreme appeal to
the diplomatic intervention of your Majesty's Government to safeguard
the integrity of Belgium."</p>

<p>Italy and England were now the only two important powers in Europe which
were not embroiled in war, but the moment was rapidly approaching when
the former could no longer keep out of it, if for no other reason than
to see that the balance of power in Europe was not upset. On August 4,
1914, Sir Edward Grey said in the British House of Commons, "The French
fleet is now in the Mediterranean, and the northern coasts of France are
defenseless. If a foreign fleet engaged in war against France should
come down and battle against those defenseless coasts, we could not
stand aside. We felt strongly that France was entitled to know at once
whether, in the event of attack on her unprotected coasts, she could
rely on our support. I gave the engagement to the French Ambassador last
night that if the German fleet goes into the English Channel or into the
North Sea to attack French shipping, or the French coast, the British
fleet will give all the protection in its power. That answer is subject
to the approval of Parliament. It is not a declaration of war. I
understand that the German Government would be prepared, if we would
pledge ourselves to neutrality, to agree that its fleet would not attack
the northern coasts of France. That is far too narrow an engagement."
Germany had thrown down the gauntlet in showing she intended to invade
Belgium; Great Britain here threw down the gauntlet. It could be but a
question of hours before Germany and England went to war.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, because war was already on between Germany and France, the
latter did not go to the trouble of issuing a declaration of war. And on
August 4, 1914, the Italian Government announced that "The Italian
Cabinet has decided that while some of the European powers are at war
Italy is at peace with all the belligerents. Consequently the citizens
and subjects of the Kingdom of Italy are obliged to observe the duty of
neutrality." This declaration of neutrality severed the bonds that held
Italy to the Triple Alliance. On the same afternoon, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page282" name="page282"></a>(p. 282)</span> August 4,
1914, the Russian Ambassador at Berlin was handed his passports and
departed; this official statement was given to the German press: "In
consequence of a Russian attack on German territory Germany is in a
state of war with Russia.</p>

<p>"The French reply to Germany's note has been received in the meantime,
and is of an unsatisfactory character. In addition France has ordered
the mobilization of her army so that the outbreak of war between Germany
and France must be awaited at any moment." The outbreak of war between
France and Germany was indeed near at hand, for, as we have already
seen, Germany declared war on France August 3, 1914, and on that very
day served an ultimatum on neutral Belgium and occupied Luxemburg
preparatory to an immediate invasion of Belgium. In view of the evident
long and careful preparations for just such a sudden stroke, by which to
crush France and take Paris before the French armies could offer
adequate resistance, the clumsy attempts of the Germans on August 2,
1914, to represent the French as the aggressors seem ridiculous, though
typical of German attempts to influence opinion at home and abroad. The
German Government declared that French airmen had flown over Nuremburg,
that French officers in German uniforms had crossed the German frontier
from Holland, that the French were already in Alsace. These stories
deceived no one.</p>

<p>What the neutral nations saw and understood was that the autocratic
governments of Germany and Austria-Hungary had plunged the world into a
war of incalculable magnitude, almost without warning and with
comparatively trivial pretexts. There had been only a brief mockery of
diplomatic interchanges, for the most part by telegraph and telephone.</p>

<p>On August 4, 1914, the last chance for averting war between England and
Germany went by. On that date the British Foreign Office had telegraphed
to its Envoy at Brussels: "You should inform Belgian Government that if
pressure is applied to them by Germany to induce them to depart from
neutrality, his Majesty's Government expect that they will resist by any
means in their power, and that his Majesty's Government will support
them in offering such resistance, and that his Majesty's Government
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page283" name="page283"></a>(p. 283)</span> in this event are prepared to join Russia and France, if
desired, in offering to the Belgian Government at once common action for
the purpose of resisting use of force by Germany against them, and a
guarantee to maintain their independence and integrity in future years."</p>

<p>Germany, through its Intelligence Department, was aware that this note
had been sent, but the invasion of Belgium began, nevertheless. Then
came an ultimatum from England. As soon as the British Foreign Office
had learned that German troops had crossed the border and that the
fortifications at Liege had been summoned to surrender to the German
army, this telegram was sent to the British Ambassador at Berlin:</p>

<p>"London Foreign Office, August 4, 1914. We hear that Germany has
addressed note to Belgian Minister for Foreign Affairs stating that
German Government will be compelled to carry out, if necessary, by force
of arms, the measures considered indispensable.</p>

<p>"We are also informed that Belgian territory has been violated at
Gemmenich.</p>

<p>"In these circumstances, and in view of the fact that Germany declined
to give the same assurance respecting Belgium as France gave last week
in reply to our request made simultaneously at Berlin and Paris, we must
repeat that request and ask that a satisfactory reply to it and to my
telegram of this morning [which said that England was bound to protest
against violation of Belgian neutrality] be received here by twelve
o'clock to-night. If not, you are instructed to ask for your passports
and to say that his Majesty's Government feel bound to take all steps in
their power to uphold the neutrality of Belgium and the observance of a
treaty to which Germany is as much a part as ourselves."</p>

<p>Midnight of August 4, 1914, came and the German Government had not yet
made a reply to this note; fifteen minutes of grace were allowed, and
then the British Government formally declared war.</p>

<p>The next move of a world power, toward belligerency, came in the Far
East. In 1911 Japan and England had entered an <span class="pagenum"><a id="page284" name="page284"></a>(p. 284)</span> offensive and
defensive alliance, which bound each to come to the other's aid should
that other become involved in war with more than one nation. Japan
readily agreed to live up to its part, and on August 16, 1914, sent an
ultimatum to Germany which read:</p>

<p>"Tokyo, August 16, 1914. We consider it highly important and necessary
in the present situation to take measures to remove the causes of all
disturbances of the peace in the Far East, and to safeguard the general
interests as contemplated by the agreement of alliance between Japan and
Great Britain.</p>

<p>"In order to secure a firm and enduring peace in eastern Asia, the
establishment of which is the aid of the said agreement, the Imperial
Japanese Government sincerely believes it to be its duty to give the
advice to the Imperial German Government to carry out the following two
propositions:</p>

<p>"First. To withdraw immediately from Japanese and Chinese waters German
men-of-war and armed vessels of all kinds, and to disarm at once those
which cannot be so withdrawn.</p>

<p>"Second. To deliver on a date not later than September 15 to the
Imperial Japanese authorities, without condition or compensation, the
entire leased territory of Kiao-chau, with a view to the eventual
restoration of the same to China.</p>

<p>"The Imperial Japanese Government announces at the same time that in the
event of its not receiving by noon on August 23, 1914, an answer from
the Imperial German Government, signifying its unconditional acceptance
of the above advice offered by the Imperial Japanese Government, Japan
will be compelled to take such action as she may deem necessary to meet
the situation."</p>

<p>The time limit set for the German reply came and passed with no official
communication with Berlin. Consequently the Japanese Government declared
war in the following proclamation:</p>

<p>"Issued at Tokyo, August 23, 1914, at 6 p. m.</p>

<p>"We, by the Grace of Heaven, Emperor of Japan, seated on the throne
occupied by the same dynasty from time immemorial, do hereby make the
following proclamation to all our loyal and brave subjects:</p>

<p>"We hereby declare war against Germany, and we command our army and navy
to carry on hostilities against that empire <span class="pagenum"><a id="page285" name="page285"></a>(p. 285)</span> with all strength,
and we also command our competent authorities to make every effort, in
pursuance of their respective duties, to attain the national aim by all
means within the limits of the law of nations.</p>

<p>"Since the outbreak of the present war in Europe, the calamitous effect
of which we view with grave concern, we on our part have entertained
hopes of preserving the peace of the Far East by the maintenance of
strict neutrality, but the action of Germany has at length compelled
Great Britain, our ally, to open hostilities against that country, and
Germany is at Kiao-chau, its leased territory in China, busy with
warlike preparations, while its armed vessels cruising the seas of
eastern Asia are threatening our commerce and that of our ally. Peace of
the Far East is thus in jeopardy.</p>

<p>"Accordingly, our Government and that of his Britannic Majesty, after
full and frank communication with each other, agreed to take such
measures as may be necessary for the protection of the general interests
contemplated in the Agreement of Alliance, and we on our part, being
desirous to attain that object by peaceful means, commanded our
Government to offer with sincerity an advice to the Imperial German
Government. But on the last day appointed for the purpose, however, our
Government failed to receive an answer accepting their advice. It is
with profound regret that we, in spite of our ardent devotion to the
cause of peace, are thus compelled to declare war, especially at this
early period of our reign, and while we are still in mourning for our
lamented mother.</p>

<p>"It is our earnest wish that by the loyalty and valor of our faithful
subjects peace may soon be restored and the glory of the empire be
enhanced."</p>

<p>Germany made no reply to the Japanese declaration. On August 19, 1914,
the emperor had sent word to the garrison at Kiao-chau that it was to
defend itself against all attacks made by the Japanese, and when the
commander there heard of the Japanese declaration he issued a statement
in which he invited the Japanese, if they wanted the place, to come and
fight for it.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>




<h2 class="b1"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page286" name="page286"></a>(p. 286)</span> CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<p class="title">TERRITORIAL AND GEOGRAPHICAL COMPARISONS</p>


<p>The fundamental factor in war is territory. Whether war be viewed from
the point of its relation to the racial characteristics of the nations
who are opposed, or to national rivalries, or to imperial ambitions, the
solid fact remains that war is of peoples who live upon a certain land
domain, who possess frontiers that may be attacked and must be defended,
and whose patriotism coheres with geographical boundaries. The riches of
a country depend upon territory and the density of population.
Consequently the proportion of men able to bear arms depends upon
territory, and the power of self-maintenance under times of stress&mdash;such
as a blockade&mdash;is again a territorial question.</p>

<p>The Germanic nations, known as the Central Powers, which were allied at
the opening of the war were the German Empire and the Austro-Hungarian
Empire. The area of the German Empire (exclusive of colonial
possessions) in 1914 was 208,825.2 square miles. The area of the
Austrian Empire was 115,831.9, and of the kingdom of Hungary was
125,641.2. In addition to these, the area of Bosnia and Herzegovina was
19,767.9, making the total area of the territories of the Central Powers
the sum of 470,093.2 square miles.</p>

<p>The nations known as the "Allies" in popular speech, consisted, at the
opening of the war, of the British Empire, the French Republic, and the
Russian Empire. Using the same basis of comparison, the area of the
British Isles was 121,633 square miles; the area of the Republic of
France was 207,129 square miles; and the area of European Russia,
including Finland and Poland, and excluding territory within the Arctic
circle, was approximately 2,500,000 square miles. Serbia had an area of
34,000 square miles. Belgium, although in no way responsible for the
outbreak of the war&mdash;no matter from what point of view <span class="pagenum"><a id="page287" name="page287"></a>(p. 287)</span> it may
be considered&mdash;became the nation to suffer most at first and in the very
earliest days of the war was on the side of the Allies. Her area,
exclusive of oversea possessions, was 11,373 square miles. This makes a
total of 2,874,135 square miles for the Allies, a preponderance of
territory which seems extraordinarily disproportionate until it is
realized that the British Isles, France, Belgium, and Serbia together
were far smaller than the combined territories of the Central Powers,
and that only a small proportion of European Russia was liable to become
a part of the actual field of conflict.</p>

<p>Passing on to larger figures, that is to say to the total area of all
the possessions of the nations involved, it will be seen that the
preponderance on the part of the Allies is even greater. Thus the German
Empire, inclusive of colonial possessions in Africa, in Asia, and in the
Pacific, contained 1,236,600 square miles. The Austro-Hungarian Empire,
as previously stated, was 261,239 square miles, there being no oversea
colonies. This makes a total of 1,497,839 square miles as the total
territory of the Central Powers.</p>

<p>Balanced against this come the enormous figures of the three great
allied empires. The area of the British Empire was approximately
13,158,712 square miles, the Republic of France and her colonies
4,983,086 square miles, and the Russian Empire 8,394,018 square miles.
The three empires combined thus made a total of 26,535,816 square miles,
or but very little less than one-half of the total land area of the
earth. These figures are compiled from the latest sources before the
opening of the war, but it is to be remembered that some of the figures
are approximate. For example the French possessions in Africa, of
enormous extent, have not been surveyed, and there are vast stretches of
Arctic Siberia and Arctic Canada which are but half explored. The small
territories of Belgium and Serbia may be added to the total of the three
great allied empires, and thus practically one-half of the earth on this
globe was opposed to the million and a half square miles of the Central
Powers.</p>

<p>Owing to Bulgaria's position in the Balkan Peninsula, and also owing to
aggrievement following the results of former Balkan <span class="pagenum"><a id="page288" name="page288"></a>(p. 288)</span> wars,
Bulgaria joined the Central Powers later in the war. Turkey, also,
fearing the loss of Constantinople to the Russians as a result of the
coalition of the Allies, threw her forces on the side of Germany. The
area of Bulgaria was only 43,000 square miles, but the Ottoman or
Turkish Empire was territorially very large, containing 1,420,448 square
miles, or almost as much as Germany, Austria, and Bulgaria combined. In
round numbers, and for easy remembrance, it may be said that the
territory of the Central Powers engaged in the war was about three
million square miles.</p>

<p>For a long time Italy maintained neutrality, but the onrush of
conditions forced her into the war, also on the side of the Allies. The
territory of European Italy was 110,623 square miles, and inclusive of
her African possessions the territory under the Italian flag was 706,623
square miles.</p>

<p>The territory of the Japanese Empire, also, needs to be taken into
consideration, for the reason that Japan, while not entering the
European theater of war, declared herself on the side of the Allies by
the capture of Kiao-chau, a district leased from China by Germany, and
the very next month declared to be a German protectorate. The
territorial extent of the Japanese Empire was 254,266 square miles,
inclusive of Korea. These are the principal factors to be taken into
consideration in the mere question of the territorial extent of the
opposing forces.</p>

<p>The geographical position of the belligerent countries, with their
corresponding advantages and disadvantages, is the next factor to be
considered. The geographical position of the Central Powers is best
expressed by the fact that they are central. They have all the
advantages of being in a united whole. When, later in the war, Serbia
was conquered, Bulgaria joined the Central Powers and Turkey was swung
into line, the same condition held true. Germany and her allies were a
homogeneous unit, geographically considered. From the point of view of
land defense very little of Germany's frontiers bordered upon enemy
territory. The small section that confronted France on the west and the
larger section facing Russia on the east were her only open points of
attack. Her sea front except for the small section <span class="pagenum"><a id="page289" name="page289"></a>(p. 289)</span> near the
mouth of the Rhine, was on the Baltic, and secure from naval attack
except by the Russian fleet, and Russia has never been a naval power.
Her Mediterranean outlet, near Trieste and Fiume, menaced by the
Mediterranean fleets of the allied powers, was comparatively safe, for
the Austrian fleet was an efficient fighting unit, especially so for
defense.</p>

<p>As opposed to this was the openness of England, France, and Russia to
naval attack. England has but a small proportion of land to seacoast,
and France is open to the sea on three sides. Russia, fronting the
Baltic, possessed an infinitely inferior fleet, to which the Allies
could send no reenforcement as long as the Skagerrak and Cattegat
Straits were the only way into the Baltic; moreover, by the Kiel Canal,
connecting the North Sea and the Baltic, the remodeling of which was
completed in a few months before the declarations of war, a German naval
fleet would possess an enormous advantage over an allied fleet,
endeavoring to force entrance into the Baltic. In addition to this,
while the Central Powers could work together on both fronts with great
ease, thanks to the excellent system of German railways, Great Britain
and France had no means of direct communication with their great ally in
the east of Europe. Thus, in a measure, the Central Powers were not
attacking the Allies at any one time, though it might truly be said that
they were being attacked by the Allies. In the event of any lack of
synchronization between the plans of Russia and those of the western
allies, German and Austrian troops could be massed first on one side of
the field of operations and then on the other. Such action was
impossible to the Allies. At the time of the great German advance on
Paris, Russia could give no aid. At the time of the German advance on
Riga, Britain and France could give no aid. Both German advances were
checked and the invaders driven back, not by the armies of the Allies,
but by two non-interlocking parts of the armies of the Allies. At the
same time, the susceptibility to attack on both sides prevented the
Central Powers from deflecting all their men to either front, and thus
by the mere existence of passive menace, prevented the Central Powers
from using their geographic advantage to the full.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page290" name="page290"></a>(p. 290)</span> Their disadvantage, in the military sense of the recognition of
geographical conditions, was that the Central Powers had constantly to
bear in mind the necessity of fighting upon two fronts. Russian
activity, while important to Britain and France, was a matter with which
their policy had nothing to do; the coordination of movements on the
west front was a matter entirely outside the scope of the operations of
the Russian commanders. The German military staff, on the other hand,
had the task of constantly coordinating two separate campaigns, to
determine where the greatest number of men should be, to avoid weakening
the one side or the other at the wrong moment.</p>

<p>The advantages, again considered geographically, greatly outweigh the
disadvantages. The first of these was the homogeneity of the Central
Powers. A general could attend a war council in Berlin in the evening,
and one in Vienna the next morning. The influence of Germany was an
understood thing, moreover, and in Vienna there was a readiness to
accept and carry out the policies of the German military staff. There
was also a geographical homogeneity, due to modern facility of
communication. Not only in mobilization, but in the entire conduct of
the war, the geographic nearness of points in Germany and Austria was
brought about by an excellent east and west railway system. The
disadvantage of fighting on two fronts was partly compensated by the
fact that within three days enormous masses of men could be moved from
Galicia to the Rhine, or from the Belgian frontier to the wastes of East
Prussia. In all Europe there is no stretch of land so well suited by
nature for this task of fighting upon two fronts as the area of the
combined Austrian and German Empires. This is emphasized by the
topography of the Baltic Plain, the Rhine and Danube valleys. One might
say, in a measure, that this stretch of territory has not wasted any of
its natural mountain defenses by flinging them athwart the territory.
Thus the Vosges defend against France, the Alps against Italy, the
Transylvanian Alps against Rumania&mdash;in the event of that nation entering
the war with Russia&mdash;the Carpathians behind Galicia against Russia's
southern attacks, and the marshy country east of East Prussia against
Russian northern <span class="pagenum"><a id="page291" name="page291"></a>(p. 291)</span> attack. Yet it is to be added that these very
advantages of defense were also disadvantages of attack. The march
through Belgium would not have been necessitated if, for example, the
portion of Central Powers territory that confronted France had been of
the same character as that which confronted Russia. The mountainous
character of that frontier was a determining factor in the invasion of
Belgium. The invasion of Belgium was a determining factor in the
relation which Germany sustained in the war to the allied powers, and
especially to the neutral nations. The relation of the neutral nations,
in modern warfare, which requires such immense supplies, is a factor of
great importance for success in the field. Therefore, to close the
syllogism, the mountainous character of the Vosges country was the
primary factor in determining the relation of all other countries to the
Central Powers, a factor constantly arising at every point in the Great
War. On such geographical factors does the strategy of huge campaigns
depend. One more example may be given. In the battles of the Marne it
became evident that France's strongest defense was the Argonne Forest,
in the battle of the Aisne it became clear that the geological formation
of a river bank made the German position almost impregnable.</p>

<p>The topographical position of the allied powers is the next factor to be
considered. Germany's geographical resources have been touched upon, and
to them may be added the fact that, if invaded, she had, at the Rhine, a
marvelous line to fall back upon. The first factor to be considered in
France is its openness to attack. Thanks to the Vosges and the Argonne,
a line of great strength could be established (it was so established and
was so held in the teeth of determined attack) from Belfort to Verdun.
But north of Verdun the earth-making forces have not been kind to
France, in a military sense. From Verdun to the North Sea is,
geographically speaking, open country. This is not the place to discuss
the availability of forts in open country, it is sufficient to point out
that there is no geographical defense. Between the German border and
Paris there is no topographical barrier to an invading army. The Germans
found this out in the Franco-Prussian War, and it had not been
forgotten.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>




<h2 class="b1"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page292" name="page292"></a>(p. 292)</span> CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<p class="title">ASSEMBLING OF THE GERMAN ARMIES</p>


<p>"The German mobilization was the greatest movement of people that the
world has ever seen. Nearly four million people had to be transported
from every part of the empire to her borders. The manner in which the
population is distributed made the task extremely difficult. Berlin,
Rhenish Westphalia, Upper Silesia, and Saxony, especially had to send
their contingents in every direction, since the eastern provinces are
more thinly settled and had to have a stronger guard for the borders
immediately. The result was a hurrying to and fro of thousands and
hundreds of thousands of soldiers, besides a flood of civilians who had
to reach their homes as soon as possible. Countries where the population
is more regularly distributed have an easier task than Germany, with its
predominating urban population.</p>

<p>"The difficulties of the gigantic undertaking were also increased by the
necessity for transporting war materials of every sort. In the west are
chiefly industrial undertakings, in the east mainly agricultural. Horse
raising is mostly confined to the provinces on the North Sea and the
Baltic, but chiefly to East Prussia, and this province, the farthest
away from France, had to send its best horses to the western border, as
did also Schleswig-Holstein and Hanover. Coal for our warships had to go
in the other direction. From the Rhenish mines it went to the North Sea,
from Upper Silesia to the Baltic. Ammunition and heavy projectiles were
transported from the central part of the empire to its borders. And
everywhere these operations had to be carried on with haste....</p>

<p>"And how was it carried on? No one could have wondered if there had been
hundreds of unforeseen incidents, if military trains had arrived at
their stations with great delays, if there had resulted in many places a
wild hugger-mugger from the tremendous problems on hand. But there was
not a trace of this. ... All moved with the regularity of clockwork.
Regiments <span class="pagenum"><a id="page294" name="page294"></a>(p. 294)</span> that had been ordered to mobilize in the forenoon
left in the evening for the field, fully equipped....</p>

<a id="img016" name="img016"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img016.jpg" width="600" height="393" alt="" title="">
<p>Armies of the Contesting Nations.</p></div>

<p>"A thing that raised the national enthusiasm still higher was the
appearance of the troops in brand-new uniforms, complete from head to
feet. The first sight of these new uniforms of modest, field gray,
faultlessly made, evoked everywhere the question: Where did they come
from? On the first day of mobilization dozens of cloth manufacturers
appeared at the War Ministry with offers of new material. 'We don't want
any' was the astonishing reply. Equal amazement was caused by the
faultless boots and shoes of the new troops, especially in view of the
recent famous 'boot speech' of the French Senator Humbert.</p>

<p>"Small arms, cannon, and ammunition are so plentiful, that they have
merely to be unpacked. In view of all this, it is no wonder that the
regiments marching in were everywhere greeted with jubilation, and that
those marching out took leave of their garrisons with joyful songs. No
one thinks of death and destruction, every one of happy victory and
joyful reunion. German discipline, once so slandered, now celebrates its
triumph.</p>

<p>"There was still another matter in which the troops gave their
countrymen cause for rejoicing. Not one drunken man was seen during
these earnest days on the city streets. The General Staff had, moreover,
wisely ordered that during the mobilization, when every one had money in
his pockets, alcoholic drinks were not to be sold at the railroad
stations....</p>

<p>"The army is increased to many times its ordinary strength by the
mobilization. It draws from everywhere millions of soldiers, workmen,
horses, wagons, and other materials. The entire railway service is at
its disposal.... Not only is our great army mobilized, but the whole
folk is mobilized, and the distribution of labor, the food question, and
the care of the sick and wounded are all being provided for. The whole
German folk has become a gigantic war camp, all are mobilized to protect
kaiser, folk, and fatherland, as the closing report of the Reichstag put
it."</p>

<p>From this German statement of German mobilization by a German committee
of men of the utmost standing in the empire <span class="pagenum"><a id="page295" name="page295"></a>(p. 295)</span> certain things
stand out very clearly. Of this the first one is that, with a peace
strength of less than a million, on the very first flush of
mobilization, every possible contingency for the mobilization of four
million men was at hand. German mobilization, therefore, was not the
devising of plans to carry out a project, but it was rather the putting
into action of a vast interacting series of preparation that had long
been made and carefully conceived for an attack upon the powers to the
westward. From every point of view, looking at the mobilization at the
opening of the war, Germany's was the most rapid and the most complete,
and, as the "Truth about Germany" states, it was perhaps the most
marvelous piece of military mobilization that the world has ever seen.</p>

<p>As mobilization finally results in army corps, and is designed to fit
into a frame, the component parts of an army corps may be set forth to
show the way in which all the various units have to be drawn together to
their places on a battle front. A complete army corps of the German
scheme consists of 56,000 combatants and 12,000 men in the supply train.
Of this, 63.81 per cent are infantry, 11.56 per cent cavalry, 10.99
field artillery, 4.21 per cent light artillery, 4.21 engineer corps,
etc., hospital corps 1.04, and miscellaneous 2.02 per cent. There are 4
brigades with 24 battalions, there are 24 batteries of field artillery
with 144 guns, there are 8 squadrons of cavalry, 4 howitzer batteries
with 16 heavy howitzers, a machine-gun section, a battalion of rifles, a
battalion of engineers, a telegraph section, a bridge train, 6 provision
columns, 7 wagon-park columns, a stretcher-bearer column, a horse depot,
a field bakery, 12 field hospitals, and 8 ammunition columns.</p>

<p>One has but to think of the various places from which these men and
stores must come, of the thousands of horses and hundreds of wagons; of
the millions of rounds of ammunition, speeding from different points
over different railroads, and when disembarked by roads, by lanes, even
by small bypaths to the appointed place on the battle front, to realize
what a marvelous feat is mobilization of a modern army at the time of an
outbreak of war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page296" name="page296"></a>(p. 296)</span> An insight into the manner in which this can be carried out,
and incidentally, an insight into the preparedness of Germany for the
war, is seen in an analysis of the extraordinary and otherwise
inexplicable network of railways recently erected by Germany to tap the
frontiers of Belgium and Luxemburg.</p>

<p>"In the southwest corner of Prussia," says Walter Littlefield, writing
on this subject, "is a rectangular piece of territory, the western and
eastern sides of which are formed respectively by the Belgian and
Luxemburg frontiers and the River Rhine.... Five years ago, this little
corner of Prussia had about 15.10 miles of railway to every hundred
square miles of territory. At the opening of the war this had increased
to 28.30. In five years, without any apparent industrial and commercial
demand for it, this traction has been increased to nearly twice its
length. Villages of less than 1,300 inhabitants have been linked up with
double-track lines. For example, Pelm is 2-3/4 miles from Gerolstein, a
town principally of comic-opera fame, and yet over this short distance,
between the two villages, there are laid down six parallel lines of
rail, besides numerous additional sidings.... Few of these lines, it is
to be noted, cross the frontier. Three of them, as late as last May
(this was written in the fall of 1914), led to blind terminals within a
day's march of it&mdash;the double line from Cologne via Stolberg to
Weiwertz, the double line from Cologne via Junkerath and Weiwertz to St.
With and the double line from Remagen via Hillesheim and Pelm to
Pronsfeld."</p>

<p>"Another point that is noticeable," says another observer, quoted in the
same article, "is that provision exists everywhere at these new
junctions and extensions for avoiding an upline crossing a down line on
the level, the upline is carried over the down line by a bridge,
involving long embankments on both sides (so new that as yet nothing has
had time to grow on them) at great expense, but enormously simplifying
traffic problems, when it comes to a question of full troop trains
pushing through at the rate of one every quarter of an hour, and the
empty cars returning eastward at the same rate.</p>

<p>"The detraining stations are of sufficient length to accommodate the
longest troop train (ten cars) easily, and they generally <span class="pagenum"><a id="page297" name="page297"></a>(p. 297)</span> have
at least four sidings apart from the through up and down lines.
Moreover, at almost every station there are two lines of sidings long
enough for troop trains, so that they can be used to some extent as
detraining stations, and so that a couple of troop trains can be held up
at any time while traffic continues uninterrupted."</p>

<p>Such facts of railway preparedness explain, in a great measure, the
means whereby Germany was able to launch upon the Belgian, Luxemburg,
and French frontiers such a vast array of fully equipped troops almost
at the moment of the outbreak of the war. It must be left to the reader
to determine whether there is any connection between this activity of
railroad building in a district industrially inactive on a frontier that
was always held inviolate; and the violation of that territory by means
of these very railroads. Facts remain facts, however, and the absolutely
admitted facts declare that German mobilization was directed, not at the
French frontier, but at the frontier of Luxemburg and Belgium,
especially at the great Belgian plain, commanded and dominated by the
great fortress of Liege. In the story of that siege will be shown its
topographic position. As bearing upon the subject of mobilization,
however, it is to be remembered that at this point, Belgium, and not at
France, was directed the main first mobilization of the German army.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>




<h2 class="b1">CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<p class="title">FRENCH MOBILIZATION</p>


<p>French mobilization was smooth, but slow. France's great disadvantage,
making her mobilization slow, was that her regiments were not
territorially recruited, whereas the German army was entirely based on
territorial recruitment. Where it would take a French regiment to
receive its reserve men and be completed on war footing in about four
days, the German regiment could be completed on war footing within four
to five days. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page299" name="page299"></a>(p. 299)</span> France in recognition of this weakness had on
her eastern borders special troops stationed called "troops de
couverture." Moreover, as has been pointed out, all the French railways
center in Paris, and the nearness of the capital to the frontier is a
gain as well as a source of danger. Therefore, from the railways running
to the frontier from Paris, and from the strong garrison at the great
Verdun to Belfort chain of forts, France was able to bring into effect
at once enough men to present a strong face to the foe.</p>

<p>Here Germany's reason for invading Belgium appeared. French mobilization
assumed the integrity of Belgium and Luxemburg. Her mobilization was
directed to the German frontier. Had Germany been able to go through
Belgium without an hour's delay the situation would have been serious
for France, for she mobilized on the wrong front. Germany had correctly
assumed that France would expect her to abide by the treaties, and
consequently by disavowing these obligations had outguessed her Gallic
neighbor. The speedy mobilization of Belgium, and the heroic defense of
that little land by its gallant citizens, did much to alter the possible
destinies of the war, not because there was at any time any expectation
that Belgium would be able entirely to resist the passage of the armies
of the kaiser, but because the delay which her defense caused gave the
French troops time to mobilize in the direction whither the blow was
designed.</p>

<p>The first movement against Germany was when M. Eyschen, a member of the
cabinet of the Duchy of Luxemburg, drove in his motor car across the
great Adolf Bridge, which had been seized by Germany and confronted the
leading officer of the German advance guard with a copy of the treaty
guaranteeing the neutrality of the state. The reigning Grand Duchess
Marie Adelaide blocked the way with her motor car, she was ordered to
return at once, and when General Vandyck, commandant of Luxemburg,
arrived, he was confronted with a revolver.</p>

<p>At the end of July, when there was evidence that the storm which had
been brewing ever since Austria sent an ultimatum to Serbia on July 23,
1914, thirteen classes of Belgian recruits were called to the colors;
but even so, at its full war strength on <span class="pagenum"><a id="page300" name="page300"></a>(p. 300)</span> August 1, 1914, the
entire army numbered only 160,000 men. Owing to the small size of the
Belgian army and the small territory of that country, and also owing to
the fact that it is one of the most thoroughly equipped countries of the
world so far as railroads are concerned, Belgian mobilization presented
few difficulties for the concentration of the few available troops.</p>

<p>But Belgium was in the midst of reorganization of its national defenses
and its army, and so was <i>de facto</i> unprepared to use to the utmost the
advantages of great fortresses of Liege, Namur, and Antwerp, which could
have been made almost impregnable if the necessary field army and
artillery material had existed. The fortresses of Liege and Namur
demanded a garrison of about 250,000 men and artillery, and there were
only about 30,000 men disponible. If the organization of the national
defense of Belgium had been completed, the Belgian army would have been
probably of a strength of over 600,000 men, well trained, instead of the
poorly trained army of about 160,000 combatants equipped only for
parade, and the story of that part of the Great War would have been
another.</p>

<p>The German cavalry entered Belgium and pushed on ahead, and a few stray
shots were fired, but the first Belgian town of Limburg, on the road to
Liege, was occupied without attack. At Verviers a weak Belgian force was
driven out by the strong advance guard of the German cavalry. This was
the "peaceful invasion of Belgian territory" spoken of in the earliest
telegrams sent to the kaiser from the advancing army. Then the German
troops suddenly found themselves confronted by the destruction of the
Trois Ponts tunnels, and by the wrecked bridges across the Meuse. The
attack upon Vise, which had been figured by the Germans to be a matter
of form, and not requiring a body of troops of any size, was stopped by
blown-up bridges, and a detachment of German engineers, undertaking to
build a new pontoon bridge, was shot to pieces. Belgium, having thus
thrown down the gauntlet, concentrated its troops, a little over
100,000, on a line back of the forts of Liege and Namur. King Albert
himself was at the front, and not only directed, but also led the
defense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page301" name="page301"></a>(p. 301)</span> This gallant action on the part of Belgium formed a screen
behind which the French troops could mobilize in full order and with a
clear knowledge of the intention of the enemy. Already the skies were
filled with scouting aircraft and wireless messages buzzed incessantly
from the overhead scouts of the movements of the hostile troops rushing
from Berlin, from Cologne, from every point of the German Empire to the
three frontiers of Luxemburg, Belgium, and France. And, all the while,
the band of devoted heroes at Liege held to their ideal of independence,
and Belgium grew to be a bigger thing in the eyes of the world, as her
territory grew hourly smaller by the encroachment of the German
invaders.</p>

<p>French mobilization, in spite of the prompt action in sending the first
half million to the front, became disorganized under the discovery of
the plans of Germany. It will be remembered that the French railroad
systems all center in Paris. Therefore, in order to divert the troops to
what was seen to be the point of attack, brigades had to be brought back
from the Verdun-Belfort district and transshipped to the north. This, in
a word, was the answer to the question why France did not rush to the
aid of Belgium and hurl her forces at the Germans at the gates of Liege.
For that mobilization they were not ready. The neutrality of Belgium had
been considered as a true military barrier.</p>

<p>A glance at the railroad map of France shows how thoroughly (and
unwisely) France had trusted to this treaty, the treaty that became
famous when it was declared by Germany to be merely a "scrap of paper,"
for while there are good transport facilities to the Franco-German
frontier, there were few to the Franco-Belgian frontier. The motor
busses practically saved the day, and nearly all the French troops went
to the northern front by this means of transport. Still more difficult
was the question of munitions. The German railways brought troops at
forty miles an hour, the French lines carried munitions at forty miles
per day. For her German frontier she was ready. For this new contingency
she was unprepared.</p>

<p>For this unpreparedness France paid dearly. Some of her richest
provinces were invaded and held all through the early <span class="pagenum"><a id="page302" name="page302"></a>(p. 302)</span> part of
the war by Germany, almost solely because her transportation of troops
to the crucial point was not effective. The mere presence of the Germans
over so large a section of French territory was due solely to the
rapidity of the German mobilization, which was the result of long years
of preparation. Even behind the Belgian screen France did not move
rapidly enough to save herself, only barely rapidly enough to save
Paris. The plan of General Joffre, which entailed a gradual retreat to
let the Germans expand far from their base, while the French
concentrated between the border and Paris, was a move determined, not by
any special theory of war, nor yet by special configuration of the
country, but by the slowness of mobilization. The initial success of
Germany was a victory of thorough preparedness, the initial defeats of
the French army were the results of military preparedness hampered by
politics.</p>

<p>As the campaign developed, the mobilization of the Germans on the west
front was seen to have a double purpose. The armies of Von Kluck were to
hold Belgium and the north of France, while the armies of the crown
prince were to march through Luxemburg and batter down the
Verdun-Belfort line. It has been shown how the rapid mobilization and
gallant defense of Liege by the Belgians delayed the former. Without
aircraft it was more than possible that, behind the screen of the
forests of Luxemburg, France might not have known what forces were being
concentrated on that frontier, and might have weakened the line to rush
troops against Von Kluck. But the French aviators, who are the best in
the world, were able to fly over the territory of Germany and Luxemburg
where troops were mobilizing, and the information they sent down was
sufficiently alarming to keep France from weakening the Franco-German
fortress-defended line too seriously. This, again, handicapped France
from being able to go to the support of Belgium. The dramatic plan of
the crown prince's hammering march to Paris failed absolutely and
completely by the successful defense of Verdun.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>

<h2 class="b1"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page304" name="page304"></a>(p. 304)</span> CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<p class="title">BRITAIN&mdash;RUSSIA&mdash;AUSTRIA</p>


<p>The initial mobilization of Great Britain was a matter as well managed
as that of Germany. For precision there was nothing to choose as between
them. Yet, comparing the German and British mobilizations, one thing
stands out clearly, viz., that Germany was ready and Britain unready,
while, on the other hand, Germany had to move 4,000,000 men and England
only 100,000. To offset this, Britain had to mobilize stores and
supplies, not only for her own 100,000 expeditionary force, but for a
large part of the armies of France and for all the armies of Belgium.
Even the very motor busses that carried French troops from Paris to the
Belgian frontier were largely English, two cargoes of 100 vehicles each
being rushed across the English Channel on the same day.</p>

<p>The food question for the Belgian army and for the French armies on the
Belgian frontier was acute at the opening of the war, France was ready
and prepared to handle any eventuality in the way of supplies that might
be needed on the Belfort-Verdun line, but she was not prepared for the
conditions in the rear of the Belgian frontier. Britain came to the
support of France and Belgium without a day's delay. She rushed food and
munitions to the front, and on one occasion Kitchener fed two French
army corps, or 80,000 troops, for eleven days without the slightest
hitch. A moment's thought will show that this means not only the ability
to send food, but also to organize the entire mechanism of the preparing
and handling of that food.</p>

<p>This was made possible largely by what was known in Britain as the
motor-lorry system, unlike that of any other army, introduced in 1911.
Horse transport was relegated solely to the work of distributing, the
conveyance of supplies to the areas occupied being performed wholly by
motor transport. As the daily run of a motor lorry may be put at 100
miles, it follows that an army could advance fifty miles from its
railhead and still be easily <span class="pagenum"><a id="page305" name="page305"></a>(p. 305)</span> served with food and ammunition.
Thus, for the first time in the history of war, the British army had
devised a system whereby fresh meat and bread could be supplied daily to
a distant army. If, as the Germans declared, the British soldier thought
more of his food than fight, this desire at least had the effect of
keeping the supply system to the topmost notch. The same principle was
used for ammunition columns, in no case any of the men from the front
being detailed in the work of looking after munitions or supplies. Thus,
while British mobilization of men consisted mainly of the expeditionary
force of 100,000, the British mobilization of auxiliary columns for
aiding the supply system of the Belgian and French army was of a size
large enough to look after several corps. By this means, recruits could
be constantly forwarded to the field of war, secure in the knowledge
that no matter how rapidly men were rushed to the front, the question of
supplies was already considered and the requisites were in place
awaiting the use of the new troops.</p>

<p>England's mobilization, especially when it is remembered that after the
first 150,000 it was all volunteers, was a marvelous thing. How many men
were sent no one could tell but Kitchener, and if ever a man was born
with a gift for telling nothing, that man is Kitchener. How steadily
recruits poured over no one knew. Officially, only enough men were sent
to fill up the losses in the 150,000, but before the end of the year
England's trained forces were immense. The details of the mobilization
of that first 100,000 men (the first group of the expeditionary force)
were marvelous. The railroads running to the southeast were put into
Government hands, trains were scheduled at twelve minutes' distance
apart, to run day and night, every troop train was on schedule, and
every one was unloaded and out of the depot in time for the next train
to pull in, every transport was at the dock waiting, with another ready
to take her place, and the expeditionary force was in Boulogne in less
than forty-eight hours after the first mobilization order had been sent
out. It is not to be forgotten that Britain commandeered every ship she
needed from her huge mercantile marine, and thus had transports not only
for troops but also for supplies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page306" name="page306"></a>(p. 306)</span> For a moment one may glance at a side issue, but an important
one in the mobilization, namely the mobilization of horses. The French
bought horses by the thousand in Texas. Yet English farriers inspected
them, paid for them, put them in charge of their own men on their own
ships, landed them in England or Bordeaux, fed them into prime condition
at England's own expense, and then delivered them to the French battle
line ready for service. In the first week of the war the total output of
the English rifle factories was 10,000 rifles a week (a rifle will shoot
well for only 4,000 rounds), by the seventh week of the war there were
eleven factories with a weekly output of 40,000 rifles each, and more
being built on every hand. In addition to this, between August and
December, 1914, English money mobilized&mdash;it is the word&mdash;rifle orders in
the United States to the extent of $650,000,000. It is a matter of
knowledge that many of the Russian munition orders were either financed
or indorsed by British capital. In a word, while England's military
mobilization of her regular troops was rapid and efficient, and while
her recruiting of volunteers was the greatest support of the principles
of a volunteer army that could ever be imagined, the chief importance
and the chief wonder of Britain's mobilization was her mobilization of
commerce and of trade. She made it possible for French soldiers to be
used at their full power, and France's perennial weakness&mdash;supply
organization&mdash;was supplemented by that very thing which is the British
army's chief boast.</p>

<p>It is time, now, to turn to the eastern theatre of war, and there the
diplomatic questions underlying mobilization become excessively
intertwined. All European powers watch each other like falcons above
their prey, in the constant endeavor to discern the slightest sign of
unusual military activity. The tornado of conflicting reports at the end
of July, 1914, as to which power had begun mobilizing first, as to
whether army maneuvers were a cloak for mobilization, as to whether
activity in arsenals was not a threat or as to the manipulation of
finances, were all due to a single thing&mdash;the knowledge that a week's
advantage in mobilization might mean a huge advantage, an advantage in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page308" name="page308"></a>(p. 308)</span> position so great that thousands of lives might be lost
because of the two days' delay. It has been shown how the conquest of
France's richest northern provinces by Germany was due to the difference
in speed of mobilization. There was a great deal of misunderstanding on
the part of the American public about this very importance of
mobilization. "Supposing Russia did mobilize first, or Austria," people
said, "what about it? No one has declared war." Mobilization is like two
western desperadoes watching each other. They do not wait until the
other man has drawn his gun and has them covered, but trouble begins at
the slightest move toward the hip pocket. Any move toward mobilization
is a move toward a nation's hip pocket.</p>

<a id="img019" name="img019"></a>
<div class="figcenter">

<img src="images/img019tb.jpg" width="400" height="251" alt="" title=""></a>
<p>German Confederation of 1815.</p></div>

<p>Germany did not dare to let Russia mobilize. Had a large Russian army
been concentrated in Poland, had Russia been allowed to intrench herself
on the Austrian frontier, had she had the opportunity at the beginning
of the war to seize the fortress of Thorn and to secure control of the
Vistula River, there would have been little to stop the armies of the
czar from marching into Berlin. General mobilization by one power,
therefore, absolutely compels countermobilization by another power, and
unless diplomatic agreements are speedily made and the mobilization
checked, it is a prelude to war.</p>

<p>The diplomatic interpretations of the discussion over mobilization have
been dealt with elsewhere, but it may be summarily said here that
Austria was the first of the great powers to begin mobilization in the
first part of July, in order to frighten Serbia into submission in the
controversy that arose from the assassination of the Austrian Crown
Prince at Sarajevo (in Bosnia, Austria) on June 28, 1914. Serbia
mobilized, and it was generally believed that this action was due to
Serbia's knowledge that Russia was secretly mobilizing. By about July
10, 1914, Germany believed herself satisfied that Russia was actually
mobilizing, and she also began secretly to do so. France became
suspicious of German military activity, and by the end of the third week
and the beginning of the fourth week in July a general, but unadmitted,
military preparation was in progress. Actual and admitted mobilization
is more or less arbitrarily placed as of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page309" name="page309"></a>(p. 309)</span> August 1, 1914, which
date is now generally regarded as the opening of the Great War.</p>

<p>In any consideration of Russian mobilization it will be remembered that
Russia had three armies, not one, to mobilize, i. e., the armies of
European Russia, of the Asiatic Russia, and of the Caucasus. It is also
to be remembered that, unlike the German system in which every man has a
definite place in a particular corps, the Russian system holds its
reserves as reserves solely, and organizes them after they have been
gathered together. Slow mobilization is therefore an evil not to be
avoided. For this reason one must expect to find Russian mobilization
occurring, not on the frontier, but at a point sufficiently far
therefrom to be safe from hostile attack during the period of
disorganization.</p>

<p>The line Bialystok-Brest-Litovsk was the main field selected, because of
its central location between the Austro-German frontiers, and more
particularly because it was well covered from attack by the intrenched
fortress and camp of Warsaw. The troops and reserves from Little Russia,
especially from the Kiev district, were readily available on lines
converging to the Austrian city of Lemberg in Galicia, and, it was
estimated, could take the front in ten days. From this district five
army corps are raised. From the Odessa district to the south two more
army corps could be counted upon, and these could reach the scene of
operations in twelve or thirteen days. In actual speed of mobilization
the Austrian army was ready first, but the Russian army protected and
covered the slow mobilization and concentration of its forces by a dense
curtain of cavalry masses, for which task the rapidly mobilized Cossack
cavalry was especially well fitted. These cavalry engagements&mdash;for the
Russians were met by the Hungarian cavalry&mdash;effectually screened the
actual gathering of the armies, and led Austria into the error of
supposing Russia to be quite unready. But, although Austria had been the
first to begin actual mobilization, her strategic railways on the
frontier were so poor that it was not until August 10, 1914, that she
was ready to advance, and even then that single line of railroad running
from the Bug to the Vistula was deficient in rolling stock. Austrian
military organization was excellent, Hungarian <span class="pagenum"><a id="page310" name="page310"></a>(p. 310)</span> railroad
organization was utterly inadequate to cope with the sudden requirements
of modern warfare.</p>

<p>The Austrian army advanced on Russia in force, expecting the success of
the German armies to the east. From the plans as they developed, and
particularly from railroad orders given to the lines crossing Germany,
it was expected that before Russia could be mobilized sufficiently to do
more than give a temporary check to the Austrian army, several German
army corps could be released from the western front and sent to the
Russian border to take the burden of Russian invasion away from Austria.
But the resistance of Belgium against Von Kluck's armies, the resistance
of France against the armies of the crown prince, and the resistance of
England to all naval action, prevented any release of the German armies,
and the mobilization orders for the transference of German troops from
the western theatre to the eastern theatre of war during the first few
weeks of the struggle proved to be unavailing, for the men could not be
spared. Slowly but heavily the mobilization of Russian forces continued.
Lacking strategic railroads, lacking the motor-lorry system of England,
the heavy-footed but untiring Russian infantry marched the scores and
hundreds of miles from their homes to the front. The Russian dirigibles
and aeroplanes were more than a match for the Austrian aircraft, and
kept them back from flying over the country to determine the number of
forces opposing. Then the action of the Russian "steam roller" began,
and with more men marching in every day, unwearied despite their long
travel, the steam roller gathered force. But, in one regard, Russia had
miscalculated. She had never contemplated the terrific wastage of
ammunition that is required for modern artillery duels, gun conflicts
that are necessary before troops can advance, and in the first few weeks
of the war her ammunition was all shot away. Without ammunition the
steam roller could not continue, and the advance of the Russians upon
Austrian territory was first halted and then driven back. Here, again,
then, was a campaign successfully begun because of a better mobilization
of men than was expected, and lost because of a lack of mobilization of
supplies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page312" name="page312"></a>(p. 312)</span> A great deal has been said of the slowness of Russian
mobilization, and much of it is undoubtedly true. But little has been
said about the steadiness of Russian mobilization. The Russian officer,
almost always a noble, and belonging to what is probably the most
polished and most cultured class in Europe, an aristocrat to his finger
tips, possesses the power of commanding men, and understands his Slav
soldiers. He knows that no army in the world can begin to compare with
the Russian for enduring hardship, and that no troops in the world can
sustain so large a proportion of loss and still advance. Forced marches
that would kill English troops can be handled by a Russian army without
great fatigue. The principal note in the gathering of the czar's armies
was that day by day, week by week, from every corner of the empire, men
went to the front. It was not the sudden concentration of Germany, it
was not the eager formation of France, it was not the heroic sturdiness
of Belgium, it was not the accustomedness to active service of the
British regulars, it was a gradual transition of an idealistic people
from contemplation into action.</p>

<p>German-Belgian Frontier, Strategic Railroads on.</p></div>

<p>To the Russian, more than to any other of the peoples engaged in the
war, mobilization spells advance, advance in a thousand ways. Germany,
France, and England were practically unchanged in temperament and
viewpoint by the mere processes of mobilization, but old Russia became
new Russia almost within a month. War is the greatest unifier of racial
dissension in the world, and when the first three months of war were
over, the German Empire, the British Empire, the Republic of France and
her colonies, and above all, the Russian Empire, were welded by the grim
forces of necessity into homogeneous units. Moreover, mobilization and
the conditions of war bring into high relief the powers and the
characters of the several nations, and as the story of the war is told,
its developments portray the changing appreciations of the national
combatants for each other, and of the neutral nations for all.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>





<h2><span class="pagenum"><a id="page313" name="page313"></a>(p. 313)</span> PART IV&mdash;DIPLOMATIC PAPERS RELATING TO THE ORIGIN OF THE WAR,
COLLATED FROM THE OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS</h2>


<p>Realizing the importance of presenting its case to the neutral world,
each of the warring nations published its diplomatic correspondence
leading up to the outbreak of the war, at a period during hostilities
when the publication seemed best calculated to serve the end in view.</p>

<p class="center">THE OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS</p>

<ul class="none">
<li>British White Papers, July 20 to September 1, 1914.</li>

<li>Belgian Gray Book, April 7, 1914, to September 30, 1914.</li>

<li>German White Book, July 23 to August 4, 1914.</li>

<li>French Yellow Book, March 17, 1913, to September 4, 1914.</li>

<li>Russian Orange Book, July 23 to August 6, 1914.</li>

<li>Serbian Blue Book, June 29 to August 4, 1914.</li>

<li>Austro-Hungarian Red Book, June 29 to August 24, 1914.</li>

<li>Official publications in the press by Great Britain, Russia,
     Germany, and Italy, July 30 to December 6, 1914.</li>

<li>Various speeches by officers of the Governments.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is from these official documents, cast into one form by rearranging
all letters, telegrams, proclamations, speeches, etc., in their
chronological order, that the following history of the diplomatic
controversy is compiled.</p>

<p>It will be observed that, from the necessity of the case, the books of
the six principal allies against the Teutonic Powers are threefold in
number the books of those powers; and that, from choice of their
promulgators the books of the Teutonic Powers are also
disproportionately less in total volume, owing to the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page314" name="page314"></a>(p. 314)</span> almost
entire absence in them of communications between Austria-Hungary and
Germany; while the correspondence between their adversaries is presented
by these with a fulness which gives the neutral reader the impression
that nothing of importance has been withheld&mdash;indeed, that the Allies
(to use for convenience the popular designation of the anti-Teutonic
powers) have laid all their cards face upward on the table. The
intelligent reader will not have to be cautioned that this is a
psychological, rather than logical, inference.</p>

<p>If any prevalent arguments on either side fail to be upheld by the
evidence here given, it will be because this evidence does not appear in
the official documents; the editors feel that their functions do not
warrant their inclusion of pleas or testimony formed outside of the
records mentioned above. The time will not come until long after the
close of the war when the conflicting claims in the vast amount of
propagandial literature issued by both parties can be judicially weighed
by impartial historians, and presented at the bar of public opinion. In
the meantime, however, we can bring before this court the case as
officially presented by the contesting parties, a "perfect enumeration"
of all the available. The editor acts merely in a reporting capacity. He
does not discriminate between "Trojan and Tyrian," unless it be called
discrimination to refuse by allotment of lesser space to inflict on the
party neglecting fully to present its case a penalty beyond that which
necessarily results, in adverse effect, on the mind of the reader from
this omission.</p>

<p>In brief, the controversy is presented as a case in law. The evidence is
given in the correspondence between ministers of state and the pleadings
are presented in the words of responsible statesmen, who apply this
evidence to the issues in question.</p>

<p>Since the validity of the evidence is based not only on its inherent
motive but on the character and authority of those communicating it, and
the force of the pleadings is even more dependent upon the character and
authority of the advocates, it is necessary at the outset to state the
offices held by the chief representatives of the parties to the
controversy, and to present <span class="pagenum"><a id="page315" name="page315"></a>(p. 315)</span> something of their past records,
especially in the case of the more responsible statesmen. This will also
serve to make graphic the story of the great trial before the bar of the
world; it will visualize it as a contest, man to man, in which the
distance between the combatants is eliminated, and they seem to be in
each other's presence, testifying and arguing in behalf of their
respective causes, as in a case at law. And, when it is borne in mind
that these persons are representative of the dignity of great and
sovereign peoples, the exponents and conservators of their national and
individual rights and aspirations, their ideas and ideals of
civilization, the contest will gain rather than lose in impressiveness
by the concrete form in which it is presented. The sovereigns and
statesmen of the anti-Teutonic allies are listed first; of the Teutonic
allies next, and a few statesmen of neutral countries who were involved
in the controversy last.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>

<p>"In general, Grey is often supposed to represent the principle of
continuity in foreign policy, but this is not quite exact. In certain
very large issues the Liberal Government of 1906 and onward agreed
entirely with the conservative policy of Lord Salisbury (Prime
Minister), and Lord Lansdowne (Foreign Secretary), and therefore
followed their action. On other issues it differed. For instance, it
stopped indentured Chinese labor in the Transvaal, and it granted
immediate self-government to South Africa. But in Europe the policy has
been mostly continuous. The principles are conveniently stated in the
House of Commons debate of foreign policy on November 27, 1911:</p>

<p>"'1. In my opinion the wise policy for this country is to expand as
little as possible.' 'I say without any hesitation that we do not desire
accessions of territory, and in saying that I am not speaking for one
small section of the House. I believe I am speaking for the nation at
large.' The first sentence comes from Sir Edward Grey, the second from
Mr. Bonar Law (leader of the opposition).</p>

<p>"This is made a little clearer in a latter sentence of Sir Edward Grey's
speech. 'If there are to be changes of territory brought about by good
will and negotiation between other powers, then we are not an ambitious
competing party.... And if it is wise policy not to go in for great
schemes of expansion ourselves, then I think it would be morally and
diplomatically wrong to indulge in a dog-in-the-manger policy in regard
to others.' In particular, he explains, if Germany wishes, 'by friendly
arrangement with other powers,' to extend her territories, we do not
wish to stand in her way, or to claim 'compensations.'"</p>

<h4>WARNINGS OF HOSTILE INTENTIONS</h4>

<p>The first evidence presented before the court of nations was that of
France, in regard to the hostile intentions of Germany. To this Germany
has made no official answer in the form of documentary evidence, and any
inference as to the hostile intentions of France against Germany, if
there were any, must be inferred by the reader without any help from
cross-examination by the official advocates of Germany. The value of the
French evidence must be judged by later events. Have they, or have they
not, corroborated the anticipations of France, held for a year before
the war, as to an attack upon her by Germany?</p>

<p>On March 17, 1913, M. Jules Cambon, French Ambassador at Berlin, wrote
to M. Jonnart, Minister for Foreign Affairs in Paris, transmitting
reports by French military and naval attachés in Berlin to their
respective French departments on German military affairs, and called his
attention to the importance of the documents. Delay, he said, in the
publication of the reports was due to lack of funds wherewith to provide
for these military measures. The rich classes objected to a forced levy
in times of peace, and the Federal states to the Imperial Government
adopting direct taxation which had heretofore been reserved to them.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"However this may be, in increasing the strength of the German
     army the empire desires to leave nothing to chance in the event
     of a possible crisis.</p>

     <p>"The German changes have produced a result unexpected by that
     country, viz., the proposal of the Government of the [French]
     Republic to reestablish the three years' service, and the manly
     determination with which this proposal has been welcomed in
     France. The surprise occasioned by these proposals of insisting
     on the absolute necessity of an increase of German military
     strength; the German proposals are represented as a reply
     <span class="pagenum"><a id="page329" name="page329"></a>(p. 329)</span> to our own. The reverse is the case, since the immense
     military effort which France is undertaking is but the
     consequence of German initiative.</p>

     <p>"The Imperial Government is constantly rousing patriotic
     sentiment. Every day the emperor delights to revive memories of
     1813. Yesterday evening a military tattoo went through the
     streets of Berlin, speeches were delivered in which the present
     situation was compared to that of a hundred years ago.... It was
     of course to be expected that national patriotism would be worked
     up just when fresh sacrifices are being required, but to compare
     the present time to 1813 is to misuse an historical analogy. If,
     to-day, there is anything corresponding to the movement which a
     hundred years ago roused Germans to fight the man of genius who
     aspired to universal dominion, it is in France that such a
     counterpart would have to be sought, since the French nation
     seeks but to protect itself against the domination of force.</p>

     <p>"Nevertheless, it is true that the state of public opinion in
     both countries makes the situation grave."</p>
</div>

<p>The first inclosure in M. Cambon's letter was the report of Lieutenant
Colonel Serret. He speaks of a "virulent" article in the "Kölnische
Zeitung" ("Cologne Gazette") on the menace of France, which, though
immediately disavowed by the Government, cannot be disregarded, since
its sentiments have been approved by other prominent newspapers, and it
appears to express a "real feeling" among the people, a "latent anger."
It throws light on the present German armaments.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"For some time now it has been quite a common thing to meet
     people who declare that the military plans of France are
     extraordinary and unjustified. In a drawing room a member of the
     Reichstag who is not a fanatic, speaking of the three years'
     service in France, went so far as to say: 'It is a provocation;
     we will not allow it.' More moderate persons, military and civil,
     glibly voice the opinion that France with her 40,000,000
     inhabitants has no right to compete in this way with Germany.</p>

     <p>"To sum up, people are angry, and this anger is not caused by the
     shrieking of certain French papers, to which sober-minded people
     pay little attention. It is a case of vexation. People are angry
     at realizing that in spite of the enormous effort made last year,
     continued and even increased this year, it will probably not be
     possible this time to outrun France completely.</p>

     <p>"To outdistance us, since we neither will nor can be allied with
     her, is Germany's real aim....</p>

     <p>"At the moment when German military strength is on the point of
     acquiring that final superiority which, should the occasion
     arise, would force us to submit to humiliation or destruction,
     France suddenly refuses to abdicate, and shows, as Renan said:
     'her eternal power of renaissance and resurrection.' The disgust
     of Germany can well be understood.</p>

     <p>"Of course the Government points to the general situation in
     Europe and speaks of the 'Slav Peril.' As far as I can see,
     however, public opinion <span class="pagenum"><a id="page330" name="page330"></a>(p. 330)</span> really seems indifferent to
     this 'Peril,' and yet it has accepted with a good grace, if not
     with welcome, the enormous burdens of these two successive
     laws....</p>

     <p>"To sum up, if public opinion does not actually point at France,
     as does the 'Kölnische Zeitung,' we are in fact, and shall long
     remain the nation aimed at. Germany considers that for our
     40,000,000 of inhabitants our place in the sun is really too
     large.</p>

     <p>"Germans wish for peace&mdash;so they keep on proclaiming, and the
     emperor more than anyone&mdash;but they do not understand peace as
     involving either mutual concessions or a balance of armaments.
     They want to be feared and they are at present engaged in making
     the necessary sacrifices. If on some occasion their national
     vanity is wounded, the confidence which the country will feel in
     the enormous superiority of its army will be favorable to an
     explosion of national anger, in the face of which the moderation
     of the Imperial Government will perhaps be powerless.</p>

     <p>"It must be emphasized again that the Government is doing
     everything to increase patriotic sentiment by celebrating with
     éclat all the various anniversaries of 1813.</p>

     <p>"The trend of public opinion would result in giving a war a more
     or less national character. By whatever pretext Germany should
     justify the European conflagration, nothing can prevent the first
     decisive blows being struck at France."</p>
</div>

<p>The second inclosure in M. Cambon's letter is the report of M. de
Faramond, Naval Attaché. He says that there will be no increase in the
German fleet this year, and that the whole military effort will be
directed against France.</p>

<p>By October 1, 1914, the imperial army will be increased from 720,000 to
860,000 men, and proposed legislation will place the army corps near the
French frontier most nearly on a war footing, in order on the very day
of the outbreak of hostilities to attack us suddenly with forces very
much stronger than our own. It is absolutely imperative for the Imperial
Government to obtain success at the very outset of the operations....</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"William II cannot allow a retreat to enter into his
     calculations, although the German soldier is no longer to-day
     what he was forty years ago, a plain religious man, ready to die
     at the order of his king. When it is remembered that at the last
     elections 4,000,000 votes were cast by the Socialists and that
     the franchise is only obtained in Germany at the age of
     twenty-five, it may be presumed that the active army, composed of
     young men from twenty to twenty-five, must contain in its ranks a
     considerable proportion of Socialists.</p>

     <p>"It would indeed be foolish to think that the German Socialists
     will throw down their rifles on the day when France and Germany
     come to blows; but it will be very important that the Imperial
     Government should persuade <span class="pagenum"><a id="page331" name="page331"></a>(p. 331)</span> them that on the one hand we
     are the aggressors, and on the other that they can have entire
     confidence in the direction of the campaign and its final
     result....</p>

     <p>"And it is because a German defeat at the outset would have such
     an incalculable effect on the empire that we find in all the
     plans worked out by the general staff proposals for a crushing
     offensive movement against France.</p>

     <p>"In reality the Imperial Government wishes to be in a position to
     meet all possible eventualities. It is from the direction of
     France that the danger seems to them greatest....</p>

     <p>"In this connection I think it is interesting to quote a
     conversation which a member of our embassy had the other evening
     with the old Prince Henckel von Donnersmarck, as it may serve to
     reflect the opinions which dominate court circles.</p>

     <p>"Referring to the new German military proposals Prince
     Donnersmarck spoke as follows:</p>

     <p>"'French people are quite wrong in thinking that we harbor evil
     designs and want war. But we cannot forget that in 1870 popular
     opinion forced the French Government to make a foolish attack on
     us before they were ready. Who can assure us that public opinion,
     which in France is so easily inflamed, will not force the
     Government to declare war? It is against this danger that we wish
     to protect ourselves.'"</p>
</div>

<p>The prince, a veteran of the French war, expressed the opinion that
Germany would again conquer France in event of another war.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"Frenchmen, who have a great facility for work, are not as
     punctual as Germans in the fulfillment of their duty. In the
     coming war that nation will be victorious whose servants from the
     top of the ladder to the bottom will do their duty with absolute
     exactitude, however important or small it may be. And Prince
     Donnersmarck added: 'An exactitude which played so great a rôle
     forty years ago in moving an army of 500,000 men will have a far
     greater importance in the next war, when it will be a question of
     moving masses far more numerous.'</p>

     <p>"In this way the old prince gave expression to the confidence
     shared by all Germans in the superiority of their military
     organization."</p>
</div>

<p>The attaché then discusses German finances.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>He mentions particularly the large loans raised by the empire and
     Prussia: 500,000,000 marks on January 29, 1912, and 350,000,000
     marks on March 7, 1913. Quite an important part of these loans
     must have been applied to military expenses.</p>

     <p>"The military law of 1913 will require quite exceptional
     financial measures.</p>

     <p>"According to the indications given by the semiofficial press,
     the 'nonrecurring' expenditure will amount to a milliard marks,
     while the 'permanent' annual expenditure resulting from the
     increase of effectives will exceed 200,000,000 marks.</p>

     <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page332" name="page332"></a>(p. 332)</span> "It seems certain that the 'nonrecurring' expenditure
     will be covered by a war contribution levied on capital. Small
     fortunes would be exempted and those above 20,000 marks would be
     subject to a progressive tax. Presented in this guise the war tax
     would not be objected to by the Socialists, who will be able, in
     accordance with their usual tactics, to reject the principle of
     the military law and at the same time to pass the votes which
     assure its being carried into effect."</p>
</div>

<p>The attaché then discusses a subject already mentioned&mdash;the persuasion
of the rich and bourgeois classes by the Government to submit to the
increased taxation by "noisy celebrations of the centenary of the War of
Independence" in order to convince them of the necessity of sacrifice,
and to remind them that France is to-day, as 100 years ago, their
hereditary enemy.</p>

<p class="quote">
     "If it is established that the German Government are doing their
     utmost to secure that the payment of this enormous tax should be
     made in full, and not by way of installment, and if, as some of
     the newspapers say, the whole payment is to be complete before
     July 1, 1914, these facts have a formidable significance for us,
     for nothing can explain such haste on the part of the military
     authorities to obtain war treasure in cash to the amount of a
     milliard."</p>

<p>On April 2, 1913, M. Etienne, French Minister of War, wrote to M.
Jonnart, French Minister of Foreign Affairs, enclosing a German official
secret report concerning strengthening of the army. This report is
interesting in that it mentions knowledge that, as a result of her
entente with France and Russia, Great Britain was prepared to send an
expeditionary force of 100,000 to the Continent, and confesses that
Germany refrained from declaring war on France at the time of the Agadir
incident because of "the progress made by the French army, the moral
recovery of the nation, and the technical advance in the realm of
aviation and of machine guns."</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"Public opinion is being prepared for a new increase in the
     active army, which would ensure Germany an honorable peace and
     the possibility of properly ensuring her influence in the affairs
     of the world. The new army law and the supplementary law which
     should follow will enable her almost completely to attain this
     end....</p>

     <p>"Neither ridiculous shriekings for revenge by French chauvinists,
     nor the Englishmen's gnashing of teeth, nor the wild gestures of
     the Slavs will turn us from our aim of protecting and extending
     <i>Deutschtum</i> (German influence) all the world over.</p>

     <p>"The French may arm as much as they wish, they cannot in one day
     increase their population. The employment of an army of black men
     in the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page333" name="page333"></a>(p. 333)</span> theatre of European operations will remain for a
     long time a dream, and in any case be devoid of beauty.</p>

     <p>"Our new army law is only an extension of the military education
     of the German nation. Our ancestors of 1813 made greater
     sacrifices. It is our sacred duty to sharpen the sword that has
     been put into our hands and to hold it ready for defense as well
     as for offense. <i>We must allow the idea to sink into the minds of
     our people that our armaments are an answer to the armaments and
     policy of the French.</i> We must accustom them to think that an
     offensive war on our part is a necessity, in order to combat the
     provocations of our adversaries. We must act with prudence so as
     not to arouse suspicion, and to avoid the crises which might
     injure our economic existence. We must so manage matters that
     under the heavy weight of powerful armaments, considerable
     sacrifices, and strained political relations, an outbreak
     (<i>Losschlagen</i>) should be considered as a relief, because after
     it would come decades of peace and prosperity, as after 1870. We
     must prepare for war from the financial point of view; there is
     much to be done in this direction. We must not arouse the
     distrust of our financiers, but there are many things which
     cannot be concealed.</p>

     <p>"We must not be anxious about the fate of our colonies. The final
     result in Europe will settle their position. On the other hand we
     must stir up trouble in the north of Africa and in Russia. It is
     a means of keeping the forces of the enemy engaged. It is,
     therefore, absolutely necessary that we should open up relations,
     by means of well-chosen agents, with influential people in Egypt,
     Tunis, Algeria, and Morocco, in order to prepare the measures
     which would be necessary in the case of a European war. Of course
     in case of war we should openly recognize these secret allies;
     and on the conclusion of peace we should secure to them the
     advantages which they had gained. These aims are capable of
     realization. The first attempt which was made some years ago
     opened up for us the desired relations. Unfortunately these
     relations were not sufficiently consolidated. Whether we like it
     or not it will be necessary to resort to preparations of this
     kind, in order to bring a campaign rapidly to a conclusion.</p>

     <p>"Risings provoked in time of war by political agents need to be
     carefully prepared and by material means. They must break out
     simultaneously with the destruction of the means of
     communication; they must have a controlling head to be found
     among the influential leaders, religious or political. The
     Egyptian School is particularly suited to this purpose; more and
     more it serves as a bond between the intellectuals of the
     Mohammedan world.</p>

     <p>"However this may be, we must be strong in order to annihilate at
     one powerful swoop our enemies in the east and west. But in the
     next European war it will also be necessary that the small states
     should be forced to follow us or be subdued. In certain
     conditions their armies and their fortified places can be rapidly
     conquered or neutralized; this would probably be the case with
     Belgium and Holland, so as to prevent our enemy in the west from
     gaining territory which they could use as a base of operations
     against our flank. In the north we have nothing to fear from
     Denmark or Scandinavia, especially as in any event we shall
     provide for the concentration <span class="pagenum"><a id="page334" name="page334"></a>(p. 334)</span> of a strong northern
     army, capable of replying to any menace from this direction. In
     the most unfavorable case, Denmark might be forced by Great
     Britain to abandon her neutrality; but by this time the decision
     would already have been reached both on land and on sea. Our
     northern army, the strength of which could be largely increased
     by Dutch formations, would oppose a very active defense to any
     offensive measures from this quarter.</p>

     <p>"In the south, Switzerland forms an extremely solid bulwark, and
     we can rely on her energetically defending her neutrality against
     France, and thus protecting our flank.</p>

     <p>"As was stated above, the situation with regard to the small
     states on our northwestern frontier cannot be viewed in quite the
     same light. This will be a vital question for us, and our aim
     must be to take the offensive with a large superiority from the
     first days. For this purpose it will be necessary to concentrate
     a large army, followed up by strong Landwehr formations, which
     will induce the small states to follow us or at least to remain
     inactive in the theatre of operations, and which would crush them
     in the event of armed resistance. If we could induce these states
     to organize their system of fortification in such a manner as to
     constitute an effective protection for our flank we could abandon
     the proposed invasion. But for this, army reorganization,
     particularly in Belgium, would be necessary in order that it
     might really guarantee an effective resistance. If, on the
     contrary, their defensive organization was established against
     us, thus giving definite advantages to our adversary in the West,
     we could in no circumstances offer Belgium a guaranty for the
     security of her neutrality. Accordingly, a vast field is open to
     our diplomacy to work in this country on the lines of our
     interests.</p>

     <p>"The arrangements made with this end in view allow us to hope
     that it will be possible to take the offensive immediately after
     the complete concentration of the army of the Lower Rhine. An
     ultimatum with a short-time limit, to be followed immediately by
     invasion, would allow a sufficient justification for our action
     in international law.</p>

     <p>"Such are the duties which devolve on our army and which demand a
     striking force of considerable numbers. If the enemy attacks us,
     or if we wish to overcome him, we will act as our brothers did a
     hundred years ago; the eagle thus provoked will soar in his
     flight, will seize the enemy in his steel claws and render him
     harmless. We will then remember that the provinces of the ancient
     German Empire, the County of Burgundy and a large part of
     Lorraine, are still in the hands of the French; that thousands of
     brother Germans in the Baltic provinces are groaning under the
     Slav yoke. It is a national question that Germany's former
     possessions should be restored to her."<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>

<h2><span class="pagenum"><a id="page335" name="page335"></a>(p. 335)</span> REPORT OF M. CAMBON IN 1913</h2>


<p>On May 6, 1913, M. Jules Cambon, French Ambassador at Berlin, wrote to
M. Stephen Pichon, Minister for Foreign Affairs in Paris, giving an
account of an interview with the German Secretary of State, Herr von
Jagow, concerning the conference of ambassadors in London on May 5th,
and the results there obtained. It was agreed by Cambon and Von Jagow
that the immediate crisis was over. Cambon submitted proofs of the
anxiety of the German Government over the crisis.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"1. Von Jagow had questioned a colleague of Cambon about Russia's
     situation in the Far East, whether there was cause for Russia to
     fear difficulties in that quarter which would cause her to retain
     troops there. The ambassador answered him that he knew of
     absolutely no trouble in the Far East, and that Russia had her
     hands free for Europe.</p>

     <p>"2. The mobilization of the German army is not restricted to the
     recall of reservists to their barracks. There is in Germany a
     preliminary measure which we have not got, and which consists in
     warning officers and men of the reserve to hold themselves ready
     for the call, in order that they may make the necessary
     arrangements. It is a general call to 'attention' and it requires
     an incredible spirit of submission, discipline, and secrecy such
     as exists in this country, to make a step of this kind possible.
     If such a warning were given in France, a thrill would run
     through the whole country, and it would be in the papers the next
     day....</p>

     <p>"The intention of the General Staff is to act by surprise. 'We
     must put on one side,' said General von Moltke, 'all commonplaces
     as to the responsibility of the aggressor. When war has become
     necessary it is essential to carry it on in such a way as to
     place all the chances in one's own favor. Success alone justifies
     war. Germany cannot and ought not to leave Russia time to
     mobilize, for she would then be obliged to maintain on her
     eastern frontier so large an army that she would be placed in a
     position of equality, if not of inferiority, to that of France.
     Accordingly,' added the general, 'we must anticipate our
     principal adversary as soon as there are nine chances to one of
     going to war, and begin it without delay in order ruthlessly to
     crush all resistance.'</p>

     <p>"This represents exactly the attitude of military circles and it
     corresponds to that of political circles; the latter, however, do
     not consider Russia, in contradistinction to us, as a necessary
     enemy....</p>

     <p>"From these events the following conclusions may be drawn ...
     these people are not afraid of war, they fully accept its
     possibility and they have consequently taken the necessary steps.
     <i>They wish to be always ready.</i></p>

     <p>"As I said, this demands qualities of secrecy, discipline and of
     persistence; enthusiasm alone is not sufficient. This lesson may
     form a useful subject of meditation when the Government of the
     [French] Republic ask Parliament for the means of strengthening
     the defenses of the country."</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page336" name="page336"></a>(p. 336)</span> On July 30, 1913, M. Pichon, French Minister for Foreign
Affairs, made an official report on the state of German public opinion,
as derived from French diplomatic and consular agents. It said that:</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"1. The treaty of November 4, 1912, is considered a
     disappointment for Germany.</p>

     <p>"2. France&mdash;a new France&mdash;undreamed of prior to the summer of
     1911, is considered ... to want war.</p>

     <p>"Members of all the parties in the Reichstag, from the
     Conservatives to the Socialists [and of all classes of the
     people] are unanimous on these two points, with very slight
     differences corresponding to their position in society or their
     political party. Here is a synthesis of all these opinions:</p>

     <p>"The treaty of November 4 is a diplomatic defeat, a proof of the
     incapacity of German diplomacy and the carelessness of the
     Government (so often denounced), a proof that the future of the
     empire is not safe without a new Bismarck; it is a national
     humiliation, a lowering in the eyes of Europe, a blow to German
     prestige, all the more serious because up to 1911 the military
     supremacy of Germany was unchallenged, and French anarchy and the
     powerlessness of the Republic were a sort of German dogma....</p>

     <p>"And the attitude of France, her calmness, her reborn spiritual
     unity, her resolution to make good her rights right up to the
     end, the fact that she has the audacity not to be afraid of war,
     these things are the most persistent and the gravest cause of
     anxiety and bad temper on the part of German public opinion....</p>

     <p>"German public opinion is divided into two currents on the
     question of the possibility and proximity of war.</p>

     <p>"There are in the country forces making for peace, but they are
     unorganized and have no popular leaders. They consider that war
     would be a social misfortune for Germany, and that caste pride,
     Prussian domination, and the manufacturers of guns and armor
     plate would get the greatest benefit, but above all that war
     would profit Great Britain.</p>

     <p>"The forces consist of the following elements:</p>

     <p>"The bulk of the workmen, artisans, and peasants, who are peace
     loving by instinct.</p>

     <p>"Those members of the nobility detached from military interests
     and engaged in business, such as the <i>grands seigneurs</i> of
     Silesia and a few other personages very influential at court who
     are sufficiently enlightened to realize the disastrous political
     and social consequences of war, even if successful.</p>

     <p>"Numerous manufacturers, merchants and financiers in a moderate
     way of business, to whom war, even if successful, would mean
     bankruptcy, because their enterprises depend on credit, and are
     chiefly supported by foreign capital.</p>

     <p>"Poles, inhabitants of Alsace-Lorraine, and
     Schleswig-Holstein&mdash;conquered, but not assimilated and suddenly
     hostile to Prussian policy. There are about 7,000,000 of these
     annexed Germans.</p>

     <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page337" name="page337"></a>(p. 337)</span> "Finally, the governments and the governing classes in
     the large southern states&mdash;Saxony, Bavaria, Württemburg, and the
     Grand Duchy of Baden&mdash;are divided by these two opinions: an
     unsuccessful war would compromise the Federation from which they
     have derived great economic advantages; a successful war would
     profit only Prussia and Prussianization, against which they have
     difficulty in defending their political independence and
     administrative autonomy.</p>

     <p>"These classes of people either consciously or instinctively
     prefer peace to war; but they are only a sort of makeweight in
     political matters, with limited influence on public opinion, or
     they are silent social forces, passive, and defenseless against
     the infection of a wave of warlike feeling.</p>

     <p>"An example will make this idea clear: The 110 Socialist members
     of the Reichstag are in favor of peace. They would be unable to
     prevent war, for war does not depend upon a vote of the
     Reichstag, and in the presence of such an eventuality the greater
     part of their number would join the rest of the country in a
     chorus of angry excitement and enthusiasm.</p>

     <p>"Finally it must be observed that these supporters of peace
     believe in war in the mass because they do not see any other
     solution for the present situation. In certain contracts,
     especially in publishers' contracts, a clause has been introduced
     cancelling the contract in the case of war. They hope, however,
     that the will of the emperor on the one side, France's
     difficulties in Morocco on the other, will be for some time a
     guaranty of peace. Be that as it may, their pessimism gives free
     play to those who favor war....</p>

     <p>"On the other hand there is a war party with leaders and
     followers, a press either convinced or subsidized for the purpose
     of creating public opinion; it has means both varied and
     formidable for the intimidation of the Government. It goes to
     work in the country with clear ideas, burning aspirations, and a
     determination that is at once thrilling and fixed.</p>

     <p>"Those in favor of war are divided into several categories; each
     of these derives from its social caste, its class, its
     intellectual and moral education, its interests, its hates,
     special arguments which create a general attitude of mind and
     increase the strength and rapidity of the stream of warlike
     desire.</p>

     <p>"Some want war because in the present circumstances they think it
     is <i>inevitable</i>. And, as far as Germany is concerned, the sooner
     the better.</p>

     <p>"Others regard war as necessary for economic reasons based on
     overpopulation, overproduction, the need for markets and outlets;
     or for social reasons, i. e., to provide the outside interests
     that alone can prevent or retard the rise to power of the
     democratic and socialist masses.</p>

     <p>"Others, uneasy for the safety of the empire, and believing that
     time is on the side of France, think that events should be
     brought to an immediate head. It is not unusual to meet, in the
     course of conversation or in the pages of patriotic pamphlets,
     the vague but deeply rooted conviction that a free Germany and a
     regenerated France are two historical facts mutually
     incompatible.</p>

     <p>"Others are bellicose from 'Bismarckism,' as it may be termed.
     They feel themselves humiliated at having to enter into
     discussions with France, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page338" name="page338"></a>(p. 338)</span> at being obliged to talk in
     terms of law and right in negotiations and conferences where they
     have not always found it easy to get right on their side, even
     when they have a preponderating force. From their still recent
     past they derive a sense of pride ever fed by personal memories
     of former exploits, by oral traditions, and by books, and
     irritated by the events of recent years. Angry disappointment is
     the unifying force of the <i>Wehrvereine</i> [defense leagues] and
     other associations of Young Germany.</p>

     <p>"Others again want war from a mystic hatred of revolutionary
     France; others, finally, from a feeling of rancor. These last the
     people who heap up pretexts for war.</p>

     <p>"Coming to actual facts, these feelings take concrete form as
     follows: The country squires, represented in the Reichstag by the
     Conservative party, want at all costs to escape the death duties,
     which are bound to come if peace continues. In the last sitting
     of the session which has just closed the Reichstag agreed to
     these duties in principle. It is a serious attack on the
     interests and privileges of the landed gentry. On the other hand,
     this aristocracy is military in character, and it is instructive
     to compare the Army List with the Year Book of the nobility. War
     alone can prolong its prestige and support its family interest.
     During the discussions on the Army Bill a Conservative speaker
     put forward the need for promotion among officers as an argument
     in its favor. Finally this social class, which forms a hierarchy
     with the King of Prussia as its supreme head, realizes with dread
     the democratization of Germany and the increasing power of the
     Socialist party, and considers its own days numbered. Not only
     does a formidable movement hostile to agrarian protection
     threaten its material interests, but in addition the number of
     its political representatives decreases with each legislative
     period. In the Reichstag of 1878, out of 397 members, 162
     belonged to the aristocracy; in 1898, 83; in 1912, 57. Out of
     this number 27 alone belong to the Right, 14 to the Center, 7 to
     the Left, and 1 sits among the Socialists.</p>

     <p>"The higher bourgeoisie, represented by the National Liberal
     party, the party of the contented spirits, have not the same
     reasons as the squires for wanting war. With a few exceptions,
     however, they are bellicose. They have their reasons, social in
     character.</p>

     <p>"The higher bourgeoisie is no less troubled than the aristocracy
     at the democratization of Germany. In 1871 they had 125 members
     in the Reichstag; in 1874, 55; in 1887, 99; in 1912, 45. They do
     not forget that in the years succeeding the war they played the
     leading rôle in Parliament, helping Bismarck in his schemes
     against the country squires. Uneasily balanced to-day between
     Conservative instincts and Liberal ideas they look to war to
     settle problems which their parliamentary representatives are
     painfully incapable of solving. In addition, doctrinaire
     manufacturers declare that the difficulties between themselves
     and their workmen originate in France, the home of revolutionary
     ideas of freedom&mdash;without France industrial unrest would be
     unknown.</p>

     <p>"Lastly, there are the manufacturers of guns and armor plate, big
     merchants who demand bigger markets, bankers who are speculating
     on the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page339" name="page339"></a>(p. 339)</span> coming of the golden age and the next war
     indemnity&mdash;all these regard war as good business.</p>

     <p>"Among the 'Bismarckians' must be reckoned officials of all
     kinds, represented fairly closely in the Reichstag by the Free
     Conservatives or Imperial party. This is the party of the
     'pensioned,' whose impetuous sentiments are poured out in the
     'Post.' They find disciples and political sympathizers in the
     various groups of young men whose minds have been trained and
     formed in the public schools and universities.</p>

     <p>"The universities, if we except a few distinguished spirits,
     develop a warlike philosophy. Economists demonstrate by
     statistics Germany's need for a colonial and commercial empire
     commensurate with the industrial output of the empire. There are
     sociological fanatics who go even further. The armed peace, so
     they say, is a crushing burden on the nations; it checks
     improvement in the lot of the masses and assists the growth of
     Socialism. France, by clinging obstinately to her desire for
     revenge, opposes disarmament. Once for all she must be reduced
     for a century to a state of impotence; that is the best and
     speediest way of solving the social problem.</p>

     <p>"Historians, philosophers, political pamphleteers, and other
     apologists of German <i>Kultur</i> wish to impose upon the world a way
     of thinking and feeling specifically German. They wish to wrest
     from France that intellectual supremacy which, according to the
     clearest thinkers, is still her possession. From this source is
     derived the phraseology of the Pan-Germans and the ideas and
     adherents of the <i>Kriegsvereine</i> [war leagues], <i>Wehrvereine</i>,
     and other similar associations too well known to need particular
     description. It is enough to note that the dissatisfaction caused
     by the treaty of November 4 has considerably swelled the
     membership of colonial societies.</p>

     <p>"We come finally to those whose support of the war policy is
     inspired by rancor and resentment. These are the most dangerous.
     They are recruited chiefly among diplomatists. German
     diplomatists are now in very bad odor in public opinion. The most
     bitter are those who since 1905 have been engaged in the
     negotiations between France and Germany; they are heaping
     together and reckoning up their grievances against us, and one
     day they will present their accounts in the war press....</p>

     <p>"During the discussion on the Army Bill one of these warlike
     diplomatists exclaimed: 'Germany will not be able to have any
     serious conversation with France until she has every sound man
     under arms.'</p>

     <p>"In what terms will this conversation be couched? The opinion is
     fairly widely spread, even in Pan-German circles, that Germany
     will not declare war in view of the system of defensive alliances
     and the tendencies of the emperor. But when the moment comes she
     will have to try in every possible way to force France to attack
     her. Offense will be given if necessary. That is the Prussian
     tradition.</p>

     <p>"Must war, then, be considered as inevitable?</p>

     <p>"It is hardly likely that Germany will take the risk if France
     can make it clear to the world that the <i>Entente Cordiale</i> and
     the Russian alliance are not mere diplomatic fictions but
     realities which exist and will make <span class="pagenum"><a id="page340" name="page340"></a>(p. 340)</span> themselves felt.
     The British fleet inspires a wholesome terror. It is well known,
     however, that victory on sea will leave everything in suspense.
     On land alone can a decisive issue be obtained.</p>

     <p>"As for Russia, even though she carries greater weight in
     political and military circles than was the case three or four
     years ago, it is not believed that her cooperation will be
     sufficiently rapid and energetic to be effective.</p>

     <p>"People's minds are thus getting used to consider the next war as
     a duel between France and Germany."</p>
</div>

<p>On November 22, 1913, M. Cambon, French Ambassador at Berlin, reported
to M. Pichon, Minister for Foreign Affairs in Paris, an account of a
recent conversation between the Kaiser and the King of the Belgians in
the presence of General von Moltke, Chief of the General German Staff,
which gravely impressed King Albert. It showed that German enmity
against France was increasing, and that the Kaiser had ceased to be the
friend of peace. The Kaiser had come to believe that war with France was
inevitable; and, when it did come, that German success was certain.
General von Moltke strengthened his sovereign in these opinions:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>"This time the matter must be settled, and your majesty can have no
conception of the irresistible enthusiasm with which the whole German
people will be carried away when that day comes.</p>

<p>"The king of the Belgians protested that it was a travesty of the
intentions of the French Government to interpret them in that sense, and
to let oneself be misled as to the sentiments of the French nation by
the ebullitions of a few irresponsible spirits or the intrigues of
unscrupulous agitators.</p>

<p>"The emperor and his chief of the General Staff nevertheless persisted
in their point of view.</p>

<p>"During the course of this conversation the emperor seemed overstrained
and irritable. As William II advances in years, family traditions, the
reactionary tendencies of the court, and especially the impatience of
the soldiers, obtain a greater empire over his mind. Perhaps he feels
some slight jealousy of the popularity acquired by his son, who flatters
the passions of the Pan-Germans and who does not regard the position
occupied by the empire in the world as commensurate with its power.
Perhaps the reply of France to the last increase of the Germany army,
the object of which was to establish the incontestable supremacy of
Germany is, to a certain extent, responsible for his bitterness, for,
whatever may be said, it is realized that Germany cannot go much
further.</p>

<p>"One may well ponder over the significance of this conversation. The
emperor and his chief of the General Staff may have wished to impress
the king of the Belgians and induce him not to make any opposition in
the event of a conflict between us....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page341" name="page341"></a>(p. 341)</span> "The Emperor William is less master of his impatience than is
usually supposed. I have known him more than once to allow his real
thoughts escape him....</p>

<p>"If I may be allowed to draw a conclusion I would submit that it would
be well to take account of this new factor, namely, that the emperor is
becoming used to an order of ideas which were formerly repugnant to him,
and that, to borrow from him a phrase which he likes to use, 'we must
keep our powder dry.'"</p>

<p>The next evidence presented before the court of the world is that by
Serbia and her witnesses, the nations thus far, to all appearances,
interested solely in maintaining the peace of Europe, as to Serbia's
non-responsibility for the assassination of the hereditary Archduke of
Austria at Sarajevo, Bosnia, on June 28, 1914, and as to her sincere
desire to do all she could, short of impairing her sovereignty and
suffering national humiliation; and that by Austria-Hungary and the same
witnesses that were brought forward by Serbia as to Serbia's complicity
in the assassination, and to Austria-Hungary's right to fix this, and to
exact guaranties that Serbia should not in the future prosecute her evil
designs against Austria-Hungary.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>




<h2>THE ASSASSINATION OF THE AUSTRIAN ARCHDUKE</h2>


<p>On June 28, 1914, M. Dumaine, French Ambassador at Vienna, reported to
M. René Viviani, President of the Council and Minister for Foreign
Affairs at Paris, the assassination that day of the hereditary Archduke
of Austria and his wife at Sarajevo, Bosnia.</p>

<p>On June 29, 1914, Yov. M. Yovanovitch, Serbian Minister at Vienna,
telegraphed to M. N. Pashitch, Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign
Affairs at Belgrade, that the Vienna press asserted that magisterial
inquiry had already shown that the Sarajevo outrage was prepared at
Belgrade; that the whole <span class="pagenum"><a id="page342" name="page342"></a>(p. 342)</span> conspiracy in its wider issues was
organized there among youths inspired with the great Serbian idea; and
that the Belgrade press was exciting public opinion by articles about
the intolerable conditions in Bosnia, papers containing which were being
smuggled in large quantities into Bosnia.</p>

<p>On the same day, June 29, 1914, Ritter von Storck, Secretary of the
German Legation at Belgrade, the Austro-Hungarian Minister, Baron Giesl
von Gieslingen being absent from his post on leave, reported to Count
Berchtold, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in Vienna, the
following facts:</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"Yesterday the anniversary of the battle of the Amselfeld was
     celebrated with greater ceremony than usual, and there were
     celebrations in honor of the Serbian patriot, Milos Obilic, who
     in 1389 with two companions treacherously stabbed the victorious
     Murad.</p>

     <p>"Among all Serbians, Obilic is regarded as the national hero. In
     place of the Turks, however, we are now looked on as the
     hereditary enemy, thanks to the propaganda which has been
     nourished under the aegis of the royal Government and the
     agitation which for many years has been carried on in the press.</p>

     <p>"A repetition of the drama on the field of Kossovo seems,
     therefore, to have hovered before the minds of the three young
     criminals of Sarajevo, Princip, Cabrinovic, and the third person
     still unknown, who also threw a bomb. They also shot down an
     innocent woman and may, therefore, think that they have surpassed
     their model.</p>

     <p>"For many years hatred against the [Dual] Monarchy has been sown
     in Serbia. The crop has sprung up and the harvest is murder.</p>

     <p>"The news arrived at about five o'clock; the Serbian Government
     at about ten o'clock caused the Obilic festivities to be
     officially stopped. They continued, however, unofficially for a
     considerable time after it was dark. The accounts of
     eye-witnesses say that people fell into one another's arms in
     delight, and remarks were heard such as: 'It serves them right;
     we have been expecting this for a long time,' or 'This is revenge
     for the annexation [of Bosnia].'"</p>
</div>

<p>On the following day (June 30, 1914), M. Yovanovitch, Serbian Minister
at Vienna, warned M. Pashitch, Prime Minister at Belgrade, by telegraph,
that the tendency in Vienna was becoming more and more apparent to
represent, in the eyes of Europe, the assassination as the act of a
conspiracy engineered in Serbia.</p>

<p>The idea was to use this as a political weapon against Serbia. Great
attention should therefore be paid to the tone of the Serbian press.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page343" name="page343"></a>(p. 343)</span> On the same day (June 30, 1914), Dr. M. Yovanovitch, Chargé
d'Affaires in Berlin, in two telegrams informed M. Pashitch that the
Berlin press was misleading German public opinion on the outrage; that
German hostility toward Serbia was growing, being fostered by false
reports from Vienna and Budapest, which were diligently spread in spite
of contradictions by some newspapers and news agencies.</p>

<p>On the same day (June 30, 1914), M. Yovanovitch, Serbian Minister at
Vienna, reported to M. Pashitch, Prime Minister at Belgrade, a
conversation he had held, in the absence of Count Berchtold,
Austro-Hungarian Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, with Baron
Macchia, Under-Secretary of the Foreign Department. In this the Serbian
Minister adopted the following line of argument:</p>

<p class="quote">
     "The Royal Serbian Government condemn most energetically the
     Sarajevo outrage and on their part will certainly most loyally do
     everything to prove that they will not tolerate within their
     territory the fostering of any agitation or illegal proceedings
     calculated to disturb our already delicate relations with
     Austria-Hungary. I am of opinion that the Government are prepared
     also to submit to trial any persons implicated in the plot in the
     event of its being proved that there are any in Serbia. The Royal
     Serbian Government, notwithstanding all the obstacles hitherto
     placed in their way by Austro-Hungarian diplomacy (creation of an
     independent Albania, opposition to Serbian access to the
     Adriatic, demand for revision of the Treaty of Bucharest, the
     September ultimatum, etc.) remained loyal in their desire to
     establish a sound basis for our good neighborly relations. You
     know that in this direction something has been done and achieved.
     Serbia intends to continue to work for this object, convinced
     that it is practicable and ought to be continued. The Sarajevo
     outrage ought not to and cannot stultify this work."</p>

<p>M. Yovanovitch said that he had communicated the substance of this
conversation to the French and Russian Ambassadors.</p>

<p>On the same day (June 30, 1914), the Serbian Prime Minister received
from M. Georgevitch, Serbian Chargé d'Affaires at Constantinople, the
information that the Austro-Hungarian Ambassador there had told him
that, in recent conversations, Count Berchtold, the Austro-Hungarian
Prime Minister and Secretary for Foreign Affairs, had expressed himself
as satisfied with the attitude of the Serbian Government, and desired
friendly relations with it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page344" name="page344"></a>(p. 344)</span> On the same day (June 30, 1914), Herr von Storck, Secretary of
the German Legation at Belgrade, telegraphed to Count Berchtold that he
had asked Herr Gruic, General Secretary of the Serbian Foreign Office,
what measures the Royal Serbian police had taken, or proposed to take,
to follow up clues to the crime which notoriously were partly to be
found in Serbia, and that the reply was that the matter had not yet
engaged the attention of the police.</p>

<p>On July 1, 1914, M. Pashitch, Serbian Prime Minister was informed by
telegraph from the Serbian Minister in London, M. S. Boschkovitch, that,
basing their conclusion on Austrian reports, the English press
attributed the Sarajevo outrages to Serbian revolutionaries. He was
informed by telegraph on the same day, by M. Yovanovitch, Serbian
Minister at Vienna, of popular hostile demonstrations in front of the
Serbian Legation, which were quelled by the police. A Serbian flag was
said to have been burned.</p>

<p class="quote">
     "Hatred against Serbians and Serbia is being spread among the
     people, especially by the lower Catholic circles, the Vienna
     press, and military circles. Please do what is possible to
     prevent demonstrations taking place in Serbia, and to induce the
     Belgrade press to be as moderate as possible in tone.... It is
     expected that decision as to the attitude to be adopted toward
     Serbia and the Serbians will be taken after the funeral [of the
     archduke]."</p>

<p>Thereupon, on the same day (July 1, 1914), M. Pashitch warned all the
Serbian legations at foreign courts of the evident purpose of the
Austrian and Hungarian press to take political advantage of the act of a
"young and ill-balanced fanatic." All ranks of Serbian society, official
and unofficial, he said, condemned the act, recognizing that it would be
most prejudicial not only to good relations with Austria-Hungary, but to
their coreligionists in that country.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"At a moment when Serbia is doing everything in her power to
     improve her relations with the neighboring monarchy it is absurd
     to think that Serbia could have directly or indirectly inspired
     acts of this kind. On the contrary, it was of the greatest
     interest to Serbia to prevent the perpetration of this outrage.
     Unfortunately this did not lie within Serbia's power, as both
     assassins are Austrian subjects. Hitherto Serbia has been careful
     to suppress anarchic elements, and after recent events she will
     redouble her vigilance, and in the event of such elements
     existing within her borders <span class="pagenum"><a id="page345" name="page345"></a>(p. 345)</span> will take the severest
     measures against them. Moreover, Serbia will do everything in her
     power and use all the means at her disposal in order to restrain
     the feelings of ill-balanced people within her frontiers. But
     Serbia can on no account permit the Vienna and Hungarian press to
     mislead European public opinion and lay the heavy responsibility
     for a crime committed by an Austrian subject at the door of the
     whole Serbian nation and on Serbia, who can suffer only harm from
     such acts....</p>

     <p>"Please ... use all available channels in order to put an end as
     soon as possible to the anti-Serbian campaign in the European
     press."</p>
</div>

<p>On the same day (July 1, 1914), Herr Jehlitschka, Austrian Consul
General to Turkey, wrote from Uskub, in European Turkey, to Count
Berchtold, Minister of Foreign Affairs at Vienna, of the actions at
Prestina on the 525th anniversary of the battle of the Amselfeld (1389),
for the first time officially celebrated as the "Festival of the
Liberation" of the Serbian nation, and carefully prepared to make it an
especially solemn and magnificent demonstration of Serbian nationality.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"The propaganda connected with this at the same time extended to
     Croatia, Dalmatia, and Bosnia, but especially to Hungary; those
     who took part in it received free passes on the Serbian state
     railways; food and lodging at low prices, maintenance by public
     bodies, etc., were promised....</p>

     <p>"The various speeches ... dealt ... with the well-known theme of
     the union of all Serbia and the 'liberation of our brethren in
     bondage' beyond the Danube and the Save, even as far as Bosnia
     and Dalmatia.</p>

     <p>"When, during the course of the evening, the news of the horrible
     crime of which Sarajevo had been the scene was circulated, the
     feeling which animated the fanatical crowd was, to judge by the
     numerous expressions of applause reported to me by authorities in
     whom I have absolute confidence, one that I can only characterize
     as inhuman.</p>

     <p>"In view of this attitude of the population, which was also
     displayed at Uskub, all attempts of the Serbian press to divest
     Serbia of the moral responsibility for a deed which was received
     by a representative gathering with such unvarnished satisfaction
     collapse miserably."</p>
</div>

<p>On July 2, 1914, M. Dumaine, French Ambassador at Vienna, reported to M.
Viviani, Prime Minister in Paris, the resentment against Serbia in
Austrian military circles and by those persons opposed to Serbia's
maintenance of the position she had acquired in the Balkans. If the
Serbian Government refused as intolerable to its dignity the demand of
Austria-Hungary that the Serbian Government investigate into the origin
of the archduke's assassination, he feared that this would furnish
Austria-Hungary a ground for resort to military measures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page346" name="page346"></a>(p. 346)</span> On the same day (July 2, 1914), Dr. M. R. Vesnitch, Serbian
Minister at Paris, telegraphed to M. Pashitch, Prime Minister at
Belgrade, that the French Government advised Serbia to remain calm, in
official circles as well as in public opinion.</p>

<p>On July 3, 1914, M. Yovanovitch, Serbian Minister at Vienna, sent two
reports to M. Pashitch, Prime Minister at Belgrade, the first containing
an account of a mob which gathered before the Serbian Legation on July
2, on account of his having hoisted the national flag at half-mast as a
sign of mourning; the bodies of the victims of the Sarajevo tragedy
having been brought that day to the Austrian capital. The police
dispersed the mob. The papers of July 3, under the heading of
"Provocation by the Serbian Minister," falsely described the incident.
The minister mentioned by name leading instigators of attacks in the
Austrian and German press on Serbia as haranguing the crowd. In the
second letter he reported a conversation he had had with Baron Macchio,
Austro-Hungarian Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, in which the Baron
severely censured the Belgrade press for its antimonarchical propaganda,
and, implicitly, the Serbian Government for not controlling the press.
The Serbian Minister had replied that the press was free, and that there
was no means of curbing it except by going to law; and, in rejoinder, he
censured the Austro-Hungarian Government, which could control the press
of its empire, for permitting it shamefully to attack Serbia by accusing
the whole nation of being an accomplice in the Sarajevo crime. Baron
Macchio had replied: "We accuse only those who encourage the Great
Serbian scheme, and work for the realization of its object." Yovanovitch
had rejoined that, till the assassination, Bosnia Serbs had been
uniformly called "Bosniaks," yet the assassin was now described as "a
Serb," and no mention was made that he was a Bosnian and an Austrian
subject. This was evidently to cast odium upon Serbia.</p>

<p>On July 4, 1914, Dr. M. R. Vesnitch, Serbian Minister at Paris, reported
to M. Pashitch, Prime Minister at Belgrade, a recent conversation with
M. Viviani, the new French Minister for Foreign Affairs, on the Sarajevo
incident.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page347" name="page347"></a>(p. 347)</span> "I described to him briefly the causes which had led to
     the outrage and which were to be found, in the first place, in
     the irksome system of Government in force in the annexed
     provinces, and especially in the attitude of the officials, as
     well as in the whole policy of the monarchy toward anything
     orthodox. He understood the situation, but at the same time
     expressed the hope that we should preserve an attitude of calm
     and dignity in order to avoid giving cause for fresh accusations
     in Vienna.</p>

     <p>"After the first moment of excitement public opinion here has
     quieted down to such an extent that the minister-president
     himself considered it advisable in the Palais de Bourbon to
     soften the expressions used in the statement which he had made
     earlier on the subject in the Senate."</p>
</div>

<p>On the same day (July 4, 1914), Dr. M. Spalaikovitch, Serbian Minister
at Petrograd,<a id="footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1" title="Go to footnote 1"><span class="smaller">[1]</span></a> telegraphed to M. Pashitch, Prime Minister at Belgrade,
that the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, M. Sazonof, had expressed
his opinion that the outrages upon the Serbs in Bosnia would increase
the sympathy of Europe for Serbia; that the accusations made in Vienna
would not obtain credence and that therefore Serbia should remain calm.</p>

<p>On the same day (July 4, 1914), Count Szécsen, Austro-Hungarian
Ambassador at Paris, telegraphed to Count Berchtold, Minister for
Foreign Affairs at Vienna, that, in officially thanking M. Poincaré for
his sympathy over the Sarajevo tragedy, the President had excused the
hostile demonstrations against Serbia by citing those against all
Italians in France after the assassination of President Carnot.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"I drew his attention to the fact that that crime had no
     connection with any anti-French agitation in Italy, while in the
     present case it must be admitted that for years past there has
     been an agitation in Serbia against the [Dual] Monarchy fomented
     by every means, legitimate and illegitimate.</p>

     <p>"In conclusion, M. Poincaré expressed his conviction that the
     Serbian Government would meet us with the greatest willingness in
     the judicial investigation and the prosecution of the
     accomplices. No state could divest itself of this duty."</p>
</div>

<p>On the same day (July 4, 1914), M. de Manneville, French Chargé
d'Affaires at Berlin, reported to M. Viviani, President of the Council
in Paris, a conversation with Herr von Zimmermann, German
Under-Secretary of State, in which von Zimmermann had expressed the hope
that Serbia would satisfy Austria's <span class="pagenum"><a id="page348" name="page348"></a>(p. 348)</span> demands with regard to the
investigation and prosecution of the accomplices in the crime of
Sarajevo. Otherwise she would be condemned by the whole civilized world.</p>

<p class="quote">
     "The German Government do not then appear to share the anxiety
     which is shown by a part of the German press as to possible
     tension in the relations between the Governments of Vienna and
     Belgrade, or at least they do not wish to seem to do so."</p>

<p>Two days later (July 6, 1914), M. Paléologue, French Ambassador at St.
Petersburg, reported to M. Viviani, Prime Minister at Paris, a recent
interview which M. Sazonof, Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, had
had with Count Czernin, the Austro-Hungarian Chargé d'Affaires at the
request of the latter. The Count intimated that the Austro-Hungarian
Government would perhaps be compelled to search for the instigators of
the crime of Sarajevo on Serbian soil. M. Sazonof interjected:</p>

<p class="quote">
     "No country has had to suffer more than Russia from crimes
     prepared on foreign territory. Have we ever claimed to employ in
     any country whatsoever the procedure with which your papers
     threaten Serbia? Do not embark on such a course."</p>

<p>On the same day (July 6, 1914), M. Yov. M. Yovanovitch, Serbian Minister
at Vienna, telegraphed to M. Pashitch, Prime Minister at Belgrade, that
the excitement in military and government circles against Serbia was
growing, owing to the tone of the press, which was diligently exploited
by the Austro-Hungarian Legation at Belgrade. On the same date he
informed the Prime Minister in detail of the press agitation against
Serbia. By headlines the people were led to infer, on the date of the
crime of Sarajevo, that the two perpetrators were Serbs from Serbia
proper. In later reports there was a marked tendency to connect the
crime with Serbia. Belgrade was indicated as the place of its origin by
the visit to that capital of the assassins, and by the bombs originating
there, which facts had been elucidated at the trial of the assassins in
Sarajevo. The Hungarian press claimed that there was evidence to show:</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"1. That the perpetrators while in Belgrade associated with the
     <i>comitadji</i> [revolutionist] Mihaylo Ciganovitch; and (2) that the
     organizer and instigator of the outrage was Major
     Pribitchevitch....</p>

     <p>"Further ... the latest announcement which the Hungarian
     <i>Korrespondenzbureau</i> made to the newspapers stated:</p>

     <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page349" name="page349"></a>(p. 349)</span> "'The inquiries made up to the present prove
     conclusively that this outrage is the work of a conspiracy.
     Besides the two perpetrators, a large number of persons have been
     arrested, mostly young men, who are also, like the perpetrators,
     proved to have been employed by the Belgrade Narodna Odbrana in
     order to commit the outrage, and who were supplied in Belgrade
     with bombs and revolvers.' [This item was later recalled.]</p>

     <p>"At the same time the Vienna <i>Korrespondenzbureau</i> published the
     following official statement:</p>

     <p>"'We learn from authoritative quarters that the inquiries
     relating to the outrage are being kept absolutely secret. All the
     details, therefore, which have appeared in the public press
     should be accepted with reserve.'</p>

     <p>"Nevertheless the Budapest newspapers continued to publish
     alleged reports on the inquiry. In the last 'report' of the
     Budapest newspaper 'A Nap,' which was reprinted in yesterday's
     Vienna papers, the tendency to lay the responsibility for the
     outrage on the Narodna Odbrana is still further emphasized.
     According to this report the accused Gabrinovitch had stated that
     General Yankovitch is the chief instigator of the outrage."</p>
</div>

<p>On the same day Herr Hoflehner, Austro-Hungarian Consular Agent at Nish,
Serbia, wrote to Count Berchtold, Minister of Foreign Affairs at Vienna,
of the satisfaction and even joy expressed, especially in the leading
circles, over the crime at Sarajevo.</p>

<p>On the next day (July 7, 1914), M. Yov. M. Yovanovitch, Serbian Minister
at Vienna, wrote to M. Pashitch, Prime Minister at Belgrade, that,
though Emperor Francis Joseph had appealed to the Prime Ministers of
Austria (Count Berchtold) and of Hungary (Count Tisza), and to the
Minister of Finance (Herr Bilinski) for calmness, it was impossible to
tell what attitude toward Serbia the Government would take.</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>"For them one thing is obvious; whether it is proved or not that
     the outrage has been inspired and prepared at Belgrade, they must
     sooner or later solve the question of the so-called Great Serbian
     agitation within the Hapsburg Monarchy. In what manner they will
     do this and what means they will employ to that end has not as
     yet been decided; this is being discussed especially in high
     Catholic and military circles. The ultimate decision will be
     taken only after it has been definitely ascertained what the
     inquiry at Sarajevo has brought to light....</p>

     <p>"Austria-Hungary has to choose one of the following courses:
     either to regard the Sarajevo outrage as a national misfortune
     and a crime which ought to be dealt with in accordance with the
     evidence obtained, in which case Serbia's cooperation ... will be
     requested in order to prevent the perpetrators escaping the
     extreme penalty; or, to treat the Sarajevo outrage <span class="pagenum"><a id="page350" name="page350"></a>(p. 350)</span> as a
     Pan-Serbian, South-Slav, and Pan-Slav conspiracy with every
     manifestation of the hatred, hitherto repressed, against Slavdom.
     There are many indications that influential circles are being
     urged to adopt the latter course: it is, therefore, advisable to
     be ready for defense. Should the former and wiser course be
     adopted, we should do all we can to meet Austrian wishes in this
     respect."</p>
</div>

<p>On July 9, 1914, M. Pashitch telegraphed to all the foreign Serbian
Legations that the Austro-Hungarian Crown Prince Alexander was receiving
daily threatening letters from Austro-Hungarians, and that they should
make use of this information with other foreign ministers and
journalists.</p>

<p>On July 10, 1914, M. Allizé, French Minister In Munich, wrote to M.
Pichon, Minister for Foreign Affairs in Paris, that the Bavarians were
asking the object of the new German armaments.</p>

<p class="quote">
     "Recognizing that no one threatens Germany, they consider that
     German diplomacy had already at its disposal forces sufficiently
     large and alliances sufficiently powerful to protect German
     interests with success."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, public opinion will support the Imperial Government in any
enterprise in which they might energetically embark, even at the risk of
conflict.</p>

<p class="quote">
     "The state of war to which all the events in the East have
     accustomed people's minds for the last two years appears no
     longer like some distant catastrophe, but as a solution of the
     political and economic difficulties which will continue to
     increase."</p>

<p>On July 11, 1914, M. d'Apchier-le-Maugin, French Consul General at
Budapest, reported to M. Vivian, Prime Minister at Paris, that Count
Tisza, Hungarian Prime Minister, had refused to make to the Hungarian
Chamber any disclosures on the Sarajevo incident until the judicial
inquiry was closed. The chamber approved.</p>

<p class="quote">
     "He did not give any indication whether the project of a
     <i>démarche</i> [proceeding] at Belgrade, with which all the papers of
     both hemispheres are full, would be followed up."</p>

<p>The virulence of the Hungarian press has diminished, and the papers are
unanimous in advising against this step, which might be dangerous.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"The semiofficial press especially would desire that for the word
     '<i>démarche</i>,' with its appearance of a threat, there should be
     substituted <span class="pagenum"><a id="page351" name="page351"></a>(p. 351)</span> the expression '<i>pourparlers</i>'
     [conversations], which appears to them more friendly.</p>

     <p>"The general public, however, fears war. It is said that every
     day cannon and ammunition were being sent in large quantities
     toward the frontier.... The Government, whether it is sincerely
     desirous of peace, or whether it is <i>preparing a coup</i>, is now
     doing all that it can to allay these anxieties.... Their optimism
     to order is, in fact, without an echo; the nervousness of the
     Bourse, a barometer which cannot be neglected, is a sure proof of
     this; without exception, stocks have fallen to an unaccountably
     low level."</p>
</div>

<p>On July 14, 1914, Dr. M. Yovanovitch, Serbian Chargé d'Affaires at
Berlin, telegraphed to M. Pashitch, Prime Minister at Belgrade, that
Herr von Jagow, German Secretary of State, had told him that
Austria-Hungary, as a great power, could not tolerate the provocative
attitude of the Serbian press.</p>

<p>On the same day M. Yov. Yovanovitch, Serbian Minister at Vienna, wrote
M. Pashitch that the Literary Bureau of the Austro-Hungarian Foreign
Office, which supplied the press with material and set its tone, was
exciting opinion against Serbia. Official German circles in Vienna were
especially ill disposed toward Serbia. The "Neue Freie Presse," under
instructions from the Vienna Press Bureau, summarized the feeling:</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"We have to settle matters with Serbia by war; it is evident that
     peaceable means are of no avail. And if it must come to war
     sooner or later, then it is better to see the matter through now.</p>

     <p>"The Bourse is very depressed. There has not been such a fall in
     prices In Vienna for a long time."</p>
</div>

<p>On the same day, July 14, 1914, M. Pashitch sent two letters to all the
foreign Serbian Legations.</p>

<p>In the first letter he gave specific illustrations of misinformation by
the Austro-Hungarian press such as that Austro-Hungarian subjects were
maltreated in Belgrade, and were now panic-stricken, and that there had
been a demonstration against the Austrian Minister at the funeral of Dr.
Hartwig, the Russian Minister. There was no foundation whatever for
these statements.</p>

<p>In the second letter he notified the Legations that the Austro-Hungarian
news bureaus, the channel of Serbian news to the world, misrepresented,
through garbling extracts, the tone of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page352" name="page352"></a>(p. 352)</span> Belgrade press, and
that all Serbian papers were forbidden entry into Austria-Hungary.</p>

<p class="quote">
     "With us the press is absolutely free. Newspapers can be
     confiscated only for <i>lèse-majesté</i> or for revolutionary
     propaganda; in all other cases confiscation is illegal. There is
     no censorship of newspapers."</p>

<p>Accordingly the Serbian foreign ministers were instructed to give out
information that the Serbian Government lacked the power to control the
newspapers, and further to spread knowledge of the fact that it was
Austro-Hungarian papers which originated all the controversies, while
the Serbian ones only replied. There was no desire in Serbia to provoke
Austria-Hungary.</p>

<p>On July 15, 1914, M. Yov. Yovanovitch, Serbian Minister at Vienna,
reported to M. Pashitch, Prime Minister at Belgrade, that the Ministers
of the Dual Monarchy had been consulting about the Sarajevo incident,
and that it appeared nothing was decided. Count Berchtold, the
Austro-Hungarian Minister for Foreign Affairs, had gone to Ischl, where
Emperor Francis Joseph was recovering from the shock of the
assassination, to report to him. Count Tisza, the Hungarian Prime
Minister, had replied evasively to interpellations made in the Hungarian
Parliament by the Opposition. Owing to the absence on leave from his
post of the War Minister and his chief of staff, the Bourse had
recovered.</p>

<p class="quote">
     "One thing is certain: Austria-Hungary will take diplomatic steps
     at Belgrade as soon as the magisterial inquiry at Sarajevo is
     completed and the matter submitted to the court."</p>

<p>In a second letter of the same date M. Yovanovitch reported to M.
Pashitch that it was thought that the inquiry had not produced
sufficient evidence to justify officially accusing Serbia more than for
tolerating in her borders certain revolutionary elements.
Austro-Hungarian methods were criticized in diplomatic circles and the
Serbian attitude was commended as in accord with the dignity of a
nation.</p>

<p class="quote">
     "In spite of the fact that it appears that the German Foreign
     Office does not approve of the anti-Serbian policy of Vienna, the
     German Embassy here is at this very moment encouraging such a
     policy."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page353" name="page353"></a>(p. 353)</span> In a third letter of the same date M. Yovanovitch informed the
Prime Minister that it appeared that Austria-Hungary would not invite
the Serbian Government to assist her in discovering and punishing the
culprits of the Sarajevo crime, but would make it a case against Serbia
and the Serbians, or even against the Jugo-Slavs (on her own border),
looking in this for the approval of Europe, which would prepare the way
for the sharp reactionary measures she contemplated to take internally
to suppress the great Serbian propaganda and the Jugo-Slav idea. The
Government must take some action for the sake of its prestige at home as
well as abroad....</p>

<p>The accusation against Serbia will extend from April, 1909, to the
present. Austria-Hungary will claim to the powers that the facts
developed therein give her the right to take diplomatic steps at
Belgrade, and demand that Serbia in future act as a loyal neighbor.
Austria-Hungary will ask Serbia to accept unconditionally her demands.</p>

<p>On the same day, July 15, 1914, M. Dumaine, French Ambassador at Vienna,
reported to M. Viviani, Prime Minister at Paris, that certain press
organs in Vienna, specifically the "Militärische Rundschau," represented
France and Russia as incapable of holding their own in European affairs,
and that Austria-Hungary, with the support of Germany, could therefore
subject Serbia to any treatment she pleased. The "Rundschau" argued that
now was the most propitious time for the war in which Austria-Hungary
would have to engage in two or three years at the latest.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"At this moment the initiative rests with us: Russia is not
     ready, moral factors and right are on our side, as well as might.
     Since we shall have to accept the contest some day, let us
     provoke it at once. Our prestige, our position as a great power,
     our honor, are in question; and yet more, for it would seem that
     our very existence is concerned....</p>

     <p>"Surpassing itself, the 'Neue Freie Presse' of to-day reproaches
     Count Tisza for the moderation of his second speech, in which he
     said: 'Our relations with Serbia require, however, to be made
     clear.' These words rouse its indignation. For it tranquillity
     and security can result only from a <i>war to the knife</i> against
     Pan-Serbism, and it is in the name of humanity that it demands
     the extermination of the cursed Serbian race."</p>
</div>

<p>On July 16, 1914, Dr. Yovanovitch, Serbian Chargé d'Affaires at Berlin,
telegraphed to M. Pashitch, Prime Minister at Belgrade, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page354" name="page354"></a>(p. 354)</span> that
Secretary of State Von Jagow had informed him that reports of the German
Minister at Belgrade pointed to the existence of a great Serbian
propaganda, which should be energetically suppressed by the Serbian
Government in the interest of good relations with Austria-Hungary.</p>

<p>On July 17 M. Boschkovitch, Serbian Minister at London, telegraphed to
M. Pashitch that the Austrian Embassy there was endeavoring to favor the
idea that Austria must give a good lesson to Serbia. Despite peaceable
official statements by Austria-Hungary the way was preparing for
diplomatic pressure upon Serbia which might develop into an armed
attack.</p>

<p>On the same day, July 17, M. Ljub Michailovitch, Serbian Minister at
Rome, telegraphed to M. Pashitch that the Marquis di San Giuliano, Prime
Minister of Italy, had stated to the Austro-Hungarian Ambassador:</p>

<p class="quote">
     "Any step undertaken by Austria against Serbia which failed to
     take into account international considerations would meet with
     the disapproval of public opinion in Italy, and that the Italian
     Government desire to see the complete independence of Serbia
     maintained."</p>

<p>On July 19, 1914, M. Pashitch telegraphed a long notice to the foreign
Serbian legations, telling of the accusation of the Austrian press from
the time of the Sarajevo outrage that the crime was the direct result of
the great Serbian idea, propagated by various associations such as the
Narodna Odbrana, which were tolerated by the Serbian Government. The
notice detailed the attitude of the Serbian Government toward the
Serbian press, presented in the preceding correspondence. In regard to
its attitude toward Austria-Hungary it said:</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"The Serbian Government at once expressed their readiness to hand
     over to justice any of their subjects who might be proved to have
     played a part in the Sarajevo outrage. The Serbian Government
     further stated that they had prepared a more drastic law against
     the misuse of explosives. The draft of a new law in that sense
     had already been laid before the State Council, but could not be
     submitted to the Skupshtina [Serbian Parliament], as the latter
     was not sitting at the time. Finally, the Serbian Government
     stated that they were ready, as heretofore, to observe all those
     good neighborly obligations to which Serbia was bound by her
     position as a European state.</p>

     <p>"From the date of the perpetration of the outrage until to-day
     not once did the Austro-Hungarian Government apply to the Serbian
     Government <span class="pagenum"><a id="page355" name="page355"></a>(p. 355)</span> for their assistance in the matter. They did
     not demand that any of the accomplices should be subjected to an
     inquiry, or that they should be handed over to trial. In one
     instance only did the Austrian Government ask for information;
     this was as to the whereabouts of certain students who had been
     expelled from the Pakratz Teachers' Seminary and had crossed over
     to Serbia to continue their studies. All available information on
     this point was supplied."</p>
</div>

<p>The notice related the anti-Serbian propaganda conducted by the
Austro-Hungarian press, the interpellations in the Hungarian Parliament,
etc., and the probable intention of the Austro-Hungarian Government to
demand a categorical reply from Serbia, which, if not satisfactory,
would be followed by war.</p>

<p>That Austria-Hungary was picking a quarrel had been evidenced by her use
of an exploded rumor of a contemplated attack on the Austrian Legation
in Belgrade to prove how excited public opinion was in Serbia, and to
what lengths she was ready to go.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"There is reason for apprehension that some step is being
     prepared against us [in the evident intention] that the inquiry
     which is being made is not to be limited to the perpetrators and
     their possible accomplices in the crime, but is most probably to
     be extended to Serbia and the Great Serbian idea....</p>

     <p>"On the other hand the Serbian Government have given their
     particular attention to the improvement and strengthening of
     their relations with the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, which had
     lately become strained as a result of the Balkan wars and of the
     questions which arose therefrom. With that object in view the
     Serbian Government proceeded to settle the question of the
     Oriental Railway, the new railway connections, and the transit
     through Serbia of Austro-Hungarian goods for Constantinople,
     Sofia, Saloniki, and Athens.</p>

     <p>"The Serbian Government consider that their vital interests
     require that peace and tranquillity in the Balkans should be
     firmly and lastingly established. And for this very reason they
     fear lest the excited state of public opinion in Austria-Hungary
     may induce the Austro-Hungarian Government to make a <i>démarche</i>
     which may humiliate the dignity of Serbia as a state, and to put
     forward demands which could not be accepted.</p>

     <p>"I have the honor, therefore, to request you to impress upon the
     Government to which you are accredited our desire to maintain
     friendly relations with Austria-Hungary, and to suppress every
     attempt directed against the peace and public safety of the
     neighboring monarchy. We will likewise meet the wishes of the
     Austro-Hungarian Empire in the event of our being requested to
     subject to trial in our independent courts any accomplices in the
     outrage who are in Serbia&mdash;should such, of course, exist.</p>

     <p>"But we can never comply with demands which may be directed
     against the dignity of Serbia, and which would be inacceptable to
     any country which respects and maintains its independence.</p>

     <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page356" name="page356"></a>(p. 356)</span> "Actuated by the desire that good neighborly relations
     may be firmly established and maintained, we beg the friendly
     Governments to take note of these declarations and to act in a
     conciliatory sense should occasion or necessity arise."<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>
</div>




<h2>ATTEMPTS AT MEDIATION</h2>


<p>With Serbia's case now fully before the courts of Europe, there began a
movement among the powers desiring to keep the peace of the continent
for mediation between the disputants. This was begun by Germany and
Great Britain.</p>

<p>On July 20, 1914, Sir Edward Grey, British Secretary of State for
Foreign Affairs, wrote to Sir Horace Rumbold, British Chargé d'Affaires
at Berlin, recounting a conversation with the German Ambassador, Prince
Lichnowsky. The prince said that Austria was certainly going to take
some step in the Serbian matter; that the situation was uncomfortable,
and that it would be desirable if Russia could act as a mediator with
regard to Russia. Sir Edward Grey presumed that the Austrian Government
would not do anything until they had first disclosed to the public their
case against Serbia, founded upon what they had discovered at the trial
of the Sarajevo assassins. This would make it easier for other powers,
such as Russia, to counsel moderation in Belgrade. The more reasonable
the demands of Austria, the easier it would be to smooth things over.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"I hated the idea of a war between any of the great powers, and
     that any of them should be dragged into a war by Serbia would be
     detestable.</p>

     <p>"The ambassador agreed whole-heartedly in this sentiment."</p>
</div>

<p>On the same day, July 20, 1914, M. Yov. Yovanovitch, Serbian Minister at
Vienna, reported to M. Pashitch, Prime Minister at Belgrade, that the
word had been passed round in Vienna to maintain absolute secrecy about
what was being done in the Serbian matter. There was no room for the
optimism reported to exist in Belgrade. It was highly probable
Austria-Hungary was preparing for war against Serbia.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"The general conviction that prevails here is that it would be
     nothing short of suicide for Austria-Hungary once more to fail to
     take advantage of the opportunity to act against Serbia. It is
     believed that the two opportunities <span class="pagenum"><a id="page357" name="page357"></a>(p. 357)</span> previously
     missed&mdash;the annexation of Bosnia and the Balkan War&mdash;have been
     extremely injurious to Austria-Hungary. In addition, the
     conviction is steadily growing that Serbia, after her two wars,
     is completely exhausted, and that a war against Serbia would, in
     fact, merely mean a military expedition to be concluded by a
     speedy occupation. It is also believed that such a war could be
     brought to an end before Europe could intervene.</p>

     <p>"The seriousness of Austrian intentions is further emphasized by
     the military preparations which are being made, especially in the
     vicinity of the Serbian frontier."</p>
</div>

<p>On the same day, July 20, 1914, a French consular report was made from
Vienna to the Government at Paris, which referred to the diplomatic
situation.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"Much will be demanded of Serbia; she will be required to
     dissolve several propagandist societies, she will be summoned to
     repress nationalism, to guard the frontier in cooperation with
     Austrian officials, to keep strict control over anti-Austrian
     tendencies in the schools; and it is a very difficult matter for
     a government to consent to become in this way a policeman for a
     foreign government. They foresee the subterfuges by which Serbia
     will doubtless wish to avoid giving a clear and direct reply;
     that is why a short interval will perhaps be fixed for her to
     declare whether she accepts or not. The tenor of the note and its
     imperious tone almost certainly insure that Belgrade will refuse.
     Then military operations will begin.</p>

     <p>"There is here, and equally in Berlin, a party which accepts the
     idea of a conflict of widespread dimensions; in other words, a
     conflagration. The leading idea is probably that it would be
     necessary to start before Russia has completed the great
     improvements of her army and railways, and before France has
     brought her military organization to perfection. But on this
     point there is no unanimity in high circles; Count Berchtold and
     the diplomatists desire at the most localized operations against
     Serbia. But everything must be regarded as possible."</p>
</div>

<p>The report commented on the departure from usage by the Austro-Hungarian
press in prominently reporting the remarks of the most obscure Serbian
newspapers,</p>

     <p class="quote">"which, just on account of their obscurity, employ language
     freer, bolder, more aggressive, and often insulting. This work of
     the official agency has obviously for its aim the excitement of
     public feeling and the creation of opinion favorable to war. The
     fact is significant."</p>

<p>On July 21 M. Jules Cambon, French Ambassador at Berlin, reported to M.
Bienvenu-Martin, Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs at Paris, that M.
Yovanovitch, Serbian Minister to Germany, had declared to the German
Government that Serbia was willing to entertain Austria's requirements
arising out of the Sarajevo outrage, provided that she asked only for</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page358" name="page358"></a>(p. 358)</span> "judicial cooperation in the punishment and prevention
     of political crimes, but that he was charged to warn the German
     Government that it would be dangerous to attempt, through that
     investigation, to lower the prestige of Serbia.</p>

     <p>"M. Browniewsky, Russian Chargé d'Affaires at Berlin, mentioned
     this subject to Herr von Jagow, German Secretary of State. Von
     Jagow said that he supposed the German Government now had full
     knowledge of the note prepared by Austria, and were therefore
     willing to give the assurance that the Austro-Serbian
     difficulties would be localized. The Secretary of State protested
     that he was in complete ignorance of the contents of that note,
     and expressed himself in the same way to me. I could not help
     showing my astonishment at a statement which agreed so little
     with what circumstances lead one to expect.</p>

     <p>"I have also been assured that from now on the preliminary
     notices for mobilization, the object of which is to place Germany
     in a kind of 'attention' attitude in times of tension, have been
     sent out here to those classes which would receive them in
     similar circumstances. That is a measure to which the Germans,
     constituted as they are, can have recourse without indiscretion
     and without exciting the people. It is not a sensational measure,
     and is not necessarily followed by full mobilization, as we have
     already seen, but it is none the less significant."</p>
</div>

<p>On the same day, July 21, 1914, M. Bienvenu-Martin, Acting Minister for
Foreign Affairs at Paris, notified the French Legations at London, St.
Petersburg, Vienna, and Rome that the Berlin Bourse was extremely weak
on the 20th, probably on account of anxiety over the Serbian question,
and that M. Cambon, French Ambassador at Berlin, had grave reason that
Germany would support Austria-Hungary in her contemplated <i>démarche</i> at
Belgrade without seeking to play the part of mediator.</p>

<p>On the same day, July 21, 1914, Baron Giesl von Gieslingen,
Austro-Hungarian Minister at Belgrade, wrote a long letter to Count
Berchtold, Minister for Foreign Affairs at Vienna, reviewing the
situation. Most of his statements have been given in more moderate
language in the preceding correspondence. He describes how the relations
between Serbia and Austria-Hungary have been "poisoned" by Serbian
national aspirations, due to the great Serbian propaganda (carried on in
Austria-Hungary as well as in Serbia), and to Serbian success in the
Balkan wars. This chauvinism has increased to a paroxysm, bordering on
insanity. The policy is to separate from Austria-Hungary the southern
Slav provinces, and so abolish the Dual <span class="pagenum"><a id="page359" name="page359"></a>(p. 359)</span> Monarchy as a great
power. Bosnia and Herzegovina are expected to revolt, and the Slav
regiments in the Austro-Hungarian army to mutiny. Out of the ruins will
be builded the great Serbian Empire, and that in the immediate future.</p>

<p>Serbian newspapers without fear of reprimand discuss the decrepitude of
the Dual Monarchy and insult her officials, and even "the exalted person
of our ruler." The press is the educator of the Serbian people; it
promoted the great Serbian propaganda, from which sprang the crime of
Sarajevo. Political parties and governmental policy are wholly
subservient to it. Its accusations that the sudden death of the Russian
Minister, Dr. Hartwig, was due to poison are on the verge of
insanity&mdash;the London "Times" called them ravings. The people, in
gratitude for the past, and in anxiety for the future, outbid one
another in servility to Russia. They despise Austria-Hungary as
powerless, for internal and external reasons. The serious words of our
statesmen are regarded as "bluff."</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"This picture leads up to the conclusion that a reckoning with
     Serbia, a war for the position of the [Dual] Monarchy as a great
     power, even for its existence as such, cannot be permanently
     avoided.</p>

     <p>"If we delay in clearing up our relations with Serbia we shall
     share the responsibility for the difficulties and the unfavorable
     situation in any future war which must, however, sooner or later
     be carried through....</p>

     <p>"Should we therefore ... put forward far-reaching requirements
     joined to effective control&mdash;for this alone could clear the
     Augean stable of great Serbian intrigues&mdash;then all possible
     consequences must be considered, and from the beginning there
     must be a strong and firm determination to carry through the
     matter to the end.</p>

     <p>"Half measures, the presentation of demands, followed by long
     discussions and ending only in an unsound compromise, would be
     the hardest blow which could be directed against
     Austria-Hungary's reputation in Serbia and her position in
     Europe."</p>
</div>

<p>On July 22, 1914, Sir Horace Rumbold, British Chargé d'Affaires at
Berlin, telegraphed to Sir Edward Grey, Secretary of Foreign Affairs at
London, that he had had an interview with the German Secretary of State,
Herr von Jagow, who insisted that the question at issue between Serbia
and Austria-Hungary was for these alone to settle, without interference
from outside, and said that it was inadvisable for the German Government
to approach the Austro-Hungarian Government on the matter. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page360" name="page360"></a>(p. 360)</span> The
German Secretary had frequently emphasized to the Serbian Chargé
d'Affaires at Berlin, M. Yovanovitch, that Austro-Serbian relations
should be put on a proper footing. He thought that Austria had acted
toward Serbia with great forbearance.</p>

<p>On the same day, July 22, 1914, M. Bienvenu-Martin, Acting Minister for
Foreign Affairs at Paris, notified the foreign French legations of the
information in M. Cambon's report of the 21st, and said that the Marquis
di San Giuliano, Prime Minister at Rome, was interceding with
Austria-Hungary that nothing impracticable be demanded of Serbia; thus,
that the dissolution of the Narodna Odbrana be required, and not a
judicial inquiry into the causes of the crime of Sarajevo. Evidently the
Cabinet at Vienna, under pressure of the press and military party, is
trying to intimidate Serbia by extreme demands, expecting German support
in this policy.</p>

     <p class="quote">"I have asked the French Ambassador at Vienna [M. Dumaine] to use
     all his influence with Count Berchtold [the Austrian Minister for
     Foreign Affairs] and to represent to him in a friendly
     conversation how much Europe would appreciate moderation on the
     part of the Austrian Government, and what consequences would be
     likely to be entailed by violent pressure on Serbia."</p>

<p>On the same day, July 22, 1914, M. Dumaine reported to M.
Bienvenu-Martin that Count Berchtold was still at Ischl evidently
waiting for the decision of Kaiser Francis Joseph on the Serbian
question.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"The intention of proceeding against Serbia with the greatest
     severity ... of 'treating her like another Poland,' is attributed
     to the Government. Eight army corps are said to be ready to start
     on the campaign, but M. Tisza [Hungarian Prime Minister], who is
     very disturbed about the excitement in Croatia, is said to have
     intervened actively in order to exercise a moderating influence.</p>

     <p>"In any case it is believed that the <i>démarche</i> will be made at
     Belgrade this week. The requirements of the Austro-Hungarian
     Government with regard to the punishment of the outrage, and to
     guarantees of control and police supervision, seem to be
     acceptable to the dignity of the Serbians; M. Yovanovitch
     [Serbian Minister at Vienna] believes they will be accepted. M.
     Pashitch [Serbian Prime Minister] wishes for a peaceful solution,
     but says that he is ready for a full resistance. He has
     confidence in the strength of the Serbian army, besides, he
     counts on the union of all the Slavs in the [Dual] Monarchy to
     paralyze the effort directed against his country.</p>

     <p>"Unless people are absolutely blinded, it must be recognized here
     that a violent blow has every chance of being fatal both to the
     Austro-Hungarian <span class="pagenum"><a id="page361" name="page361"></a>(p. 361)</span> army and to the cohesion of the
     nationalities governed by the emperor, which has already been so
     much compromised.</p>

     <p>"Herr von Tschirschky, the German Ambassador, is showing himself
     a supporter of violent measures, while at the same time he is
     willing to let it be understood that the Imperial Chancellery
     would not be in entire agreement with him on this point. The
     Russian Ambassador [M. Schebeko], who left yesterday for the
     country in consequence of reassuring explanations made to him at
     the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, has confided to me that his
     Government will not raise any objection to steps directed toward
     the punishment of the guilty and the dissolution of the societies
     which are notoriously revolutionary, but could not accept
     requirements which would humiliate Serbian national feeling."</p>
</div>

<p>On the same day, July 22, 1914, M. Paul Cambon, French Ambassador at
London, reported to M. Bienvenu-Martin that Sir Edward Grey, British
Secretary of Foreign Affairs, had told him that Prince Lichnowsky, had
stated that a <i>démarche</i> of Austria-Hungary against Serbia was expected
at Berlin, and that the German Government was endeavoring to hold back
the Austro-Hungarians, but thus far had been unsuccessful. Sir Edward
Grey had answered that he would like to believe that Austria-Hungary,
before intervening at Belgrade, were assured that the Serbian Government
had been cognizant of the conspiracy resulting in the crime of Sarajevo,
and had not done all in their power to prevent the crime.</p>

     <p class="quote">"For if it could not be proved that the Serbian Government were
     responsible and implicated to a certain degree, the intervention
     of Austria-Hungary would not be justified and would arouse
     against them the opinion of Europe."</p>

<p>The Italian Ambassador and Serbian Minister, M. Boschkovitch, share Sir
Edward Grey's apprehensions. M. Boschkovitch fears that demands will be
made on the Serbian Government which their dignity and public opinion
may not allow them to accept without protest.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"Notwithstanding the sacrifices which Serbia has made for her
     recent victories she can still put 400,000 men in the field, and
     public opinion, which knows this, is not inclined to put up with
     any humiliation.</p>

     <p>"Sir Edward Grey, in an interview with the Austro-Hungarian
     Ambassador [Count Mensdorff], asked him to recommend his
     Government not to depart from the prudence and moderation
     necessary for avoiding new complications, not to demand from
     Serbia any measures to which she could not reasonably submit, and
     not to allow themselves to be carried away too far."<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>

<h2><span class="pagenum"><a id="page362" name="page362"></a>(p. 362)</span> THE AUSTRO-HUNGARIAN NOTE TO SERBIA</h2>


<p>The expected blow now fell on Serbia. On the same day, July 22, 1914,
Count Berchtold, Austro-Hungarian Minister for Foreign Affairs, sent out
to the Austro-Hungarian Ambassadors in Berlin, Rome, Paris, London, St.
Petersburg, and Constantinople, the contents of the note which was to be
presented on the morrow to the Serbian Government.</p>

<p>A justification of the demands in it were given. All of the complaints
here made against Serbia have already been given, except the charge that</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"individuals belonging formerly to bands employed in Macedonia
     had come to place themselves at the disposal of the terrorist
     propaganda against Austria-Hungary.</p>

     <p>"The patience of the Imperial and Royal Government, in the face
     of the provocative attitude of Serbia, was inspired by the
     territorial disinterestedness of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy
     and the hope that the Serbian Government would end in spite of
     everything by appreciating Austria-Hungary's friendship at its
     true value. By observing a benevolent attitude toward the
     political interests of Serbia, the Imperial and Royal Government
     hoped that the kingdom would finally decide to follow an
     analogous line of conduct on its own side. In particular,
     Austria-Hungary expected a development of this kind in the
     political ideas of Serbia, when, after the events of 1912, the
     Imperial and Royal Government, by its disinterested and
     ungrudging attitude, made such a considerable aggrandizement of
     Serbia possible."</p>
</div>

<p>This benevolence, however, was repaid by the Serbian Government
tolerating the propaganda which ended in the crime of Sarajevo.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"In the presence of this state of things the Imperial and Royal
     Government have felt compelled to take new and urgent steps at
     Belgrade with a view to inducing the Serbian Government to stop
     the incendiary movement that is threatening the security and
     integrity of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy.</p>

     <p>"The Imperial and Royal Government are convinced that in taking
     this step they will find themselves in full agreement with the
     sentiments of all civilized nations, who cannot permit regicide
     to become a weapon that can be employed with impunity in
     political strife and the peace of Europe to be continually
     disturbed by movements emanating from Belgrade."</p>
</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page363" name="page363"></a>(p. 363)</span> The ambassadors were instructed each to submit a copy of the
note to the Government to which he was accredited, together with a
<i>dossier</i></p>

     <p class="quote">"elucidating the Serbian intrigues and the connection between
     these intrigues and the murder of the 28th of June."</p>

<p>On the following day, Thursday, July 23, 1914, Count Berchtold
telegraphed to Count Mensdorff, Austro-Hungarian Ambassador at London,
that, as Great Britain of all the powers might be most easily led to
form an impartial judgment on the action taken, in presenting the copy
of the note, he should point out that Serbia might have rendered less
acute the serious steps she must expect from Austria-Hungary by
spontaneously investigating the conspiracy tending to the crime of
Sarajevo, and that on the contrary she had endeavored to wipe out all
its traces, for example, in the case of the Serbian civil servant
Ciganovic, who was compromised by the independent testimony of both of
the assassins, and who was in Belgrade on the day of the crime, yet whom
the director of the Serbian press declared to be completely unknown in
that city.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"The short time limit attached to our demand must be attributed
     to our long experience of the dilatory arts of Serbia.</p>

     <p>"The requirements which we demand that Serbia should fulfill, and
     which indeed contain nothing which is not a matter of course in
     the intercourse between states which are to live in peace and
     friendship, cannot be made the subject of negotiations and
     compromise; and, having regard to our economic interests, we
     cannot take the risk of a method of political action by which it
     would be open to Serbia at pleasure to prolong the crisis which
     has arisen."</p>
</div>

<p>Later in the day Count Mensdorff had an interview with Sir Edward Grey,
British Secretary of Foreign Affairs, the substance of which Sir Edward
communicated on the same date to Sir Maurice de Bunsen, British
Ambassador at Vienna.</p>

<p>Count Mensdorff intimated the general nature of the note. Sir Edward
regretted the time limit set as akin to an ultimatum, and so likely to
inflame opinion in Russia, and render difficult securing a satisfactory
reply from Serbia. If it later developed that proceedings were unduly
protracted, a time limit could then be set. By that time Russian opinion
would be less excited, and, if the case appeared strong against Serbia,
the Russian Government <span class="pagenum"><a id="page364" name="page364"></a>(p. 364)</span> would be in a position to influence
Serbia to reply satisfactorily to the demands of the note. A time limit
was generally a thing used only as a last resort, when all other means
had failed.</p>

<p>Count Mensdorff instanced the bad faith of Serbia in not fulfilling her
promise of 1909 to live on neighborly terms with Austria-Hungary, and
said that, on the contrary, she had conducted an agitation to
disintegrate that country, which made it absolute for Austria to protect
herself. On this Sir Edward did not comment. He said that the French
Ambassador, M. Cambon, and the Russian, Count Benckendorff, and others
were agreed that those who had influence at St. Petersburg should exert
it on behalf of patience and moderation.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"I had replied that the amount of influence that could be used in
     this sense would depend upon how reasonable were the Austrian
     demands and how strong the justification that Austria might have
     discovered for making her demands. The possible consequences of
     the present situation were terrible. If as many as four great
     powers of Europe&mdash;let us say, Austria, France, Russia, and
     Germany&mdash;were engaged in war, it seemed to me that it must
     involve the expenditure of so vast a sum of money, and such an
     interference with trade, that a war would be accompanied or
     followed by a complete collapse of European credit and industry.
     In these days, in great industrial states, this would mean a
     state of things worse than that of 1848, and, irrespective of who
     were victors in the war, many things might be completely swept
     away.</p>

     <p>"Count Mensdorff did not demur to this statement of the possible
     consequences of the present situation, but he said that all would
     depend upon Russia.</p>

     <p>"I made the remark that, in a time of difficulties such as this,
     it was just as true to say that it required two to keep the peace
     as it was to say ordinarily that it took two to make a quarrel. I
     hoped very much that, if there were difficulties, Austria and
     Russia would be able in the first instance to discuss them
     directly with each other.</p>

     <p>"Count Mensdorff said that he hoped this would be possible, but
     he was under the impression that the attitude in Petrograd had
     not been very favorable recently."</p>
</div>

<p>On the same day, July 23, 1914, before the copy of the note had been
presented to him, M. Bienvenu-Martin, Acting Minister for Foreign
Affairs at Paris, notified the French Ambassadors at London, Berlin, St.
Petersburg, and Rome, that it was reported by M. Dumaine, French
Ambassador at Vienna, that the intention of Austria-Hungary was to
proceed with the greatest severity <span class="pagenum"><a id="page365" name="page365"></a>(p. 365)</span> against Serbia, while
keeping eight army corps ready to start operations.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Baron Macchio, Austro-Hungarian Under-Secretary for Foreign
Affairs, had assured M. Dumaine that the tone and demands of the note
were such as to allow us to count on a peaceful result.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"In view of the customary procedure of the Imperial Chancellery,
     I do not know what confidence ought to be placed in these
     assurances....</p>

     <p>"The Serbian Minister [M. Vesnitch] holds that as M. Pashitch
     [Serbian Prime Minister] wishes to come to an understanding, he
     will accept those demands which relate to the punishment of the
     outrage and to the guaranties for control and police supervision,
     but that he will resist everything which might affect the
     sovereignty and dignity of his country.</p>

     <p>"In diplomatic circles at Vienna the German Ambassador [Von
     Tschirschky] is in favor of violent measures, while at the same
     time he confesses that the Imperial Chancellery is perhaps not
     entirely in agreement with him on this point; the Russian
     Ambassador [Schebeko], trusting to assurances which have been
     given him, has left Vienna, and before his departure confided to
     M. Dumaine that his Government will not raise any objection to
     the punishment of the guilty and the dissolution of the
     revolutionary associations, but that they could not accept
     requirements which were humiliating to the national sentiment of
     Serbia."</p>
</div>

<p>On the same day, July 23, 1914, M. Allizé, French Minister at Munich,
reported to M. Bienvenu-Martin that the Bavarian press were optimistic
over a peaceful solution of the Serbian question, but that official
circles were pessimistic.</p>

<p>The note was presented at 6 p. m., Thursday, July 23, 1914, by the
Austro-Hungarian Minister at Belgrade, Baron Giesl von Gieslingen, to
the Serbian Minister of Finance, M. Laza Patchou, in the absence of M.
Pashitch, the Prime Minister, who was away electioneering. The time
limit for acceptance of its demands was forty-eight hours. Giesl added
verbally that, if the demands were not accepted within that period, the
Austro-Hungarian Legation would leave Belgrade on the morrow, Friday, at
10 a. m. This information was telegraphed that evening to the Minister
for Foreign Affairs in Petrograd, M. Sazonof, by the Russian Chargé
d'Affaires in Belgrade, M. Strandtman. Through him M. Patchou solicited
the help of Russia, declaring that no Serbian Government could accept
the demands of Austria-Hungary. M. Patchou at the same time telegraphed
to the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page366" name="page366"></a>(p. 366)</span> foreign Serbian Legations the news of the delivery of
the note, and informed them that he was in a position to state that no
Serbian Government could accept its demands in their entirety.</p>


<h4>TEXT OF THE NOTE</h4>

<p>The following are the contents of the note:</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"On March 31, 1909, the Royal Serbian Minister to the court of
     Vienna made the following statement, by order of his Government:</p>

     <p>"'Serbia declares that she is not affected in her rights by the
     situation established in Bosnia, and that she will therefore
     adapt herself to the decisions which the powers are going to
     arrive at in reference to Article XXV of the Berlin Treaty. By
     following the councils of the powers, Serbia binds herself to
     cease the attitude of protest and resistance which she has
     assumed since last October, relative to the annexation, and she
     binds herself further to change the direction of her present
     policies toward Austria-Hungary, and in the future to live with
     the latter in friendly and neighborly relations.'"</p>
</div>

<p>Here follow the charges with which the reader is already familiar: That
there is in Serbia a movement to separate certain territories from the
Austro-Hungarian monarchy, which, developed under the eyes of the
Government of Serbia, has found expression beyond that kingdom in a
series of acts of terrorism and assassination.</p>

<p>The Serbian Government has done nothing to suppress the movement, its
violent propaganda in public education and the press, or the
participation in its intrigues by public officials.</p>

<div  class="quote">
     <p>"It becomes plain from the evidence and confessions of the
     criminal authors of the outrage of June 28 that the murder at
     Sarajevo was conceived in Belgrade, that the murderers received
     the arms and bombs with which they were equipped from Serbian
     officers and officials who belonged to the Narodna Odbrana, and
     that, lastly, the transportation of the criminals and their arms
     to Bosnia was arranged and carried out by leading Serbian
     frontier officials.</p>

     <p>"These results impose upon the Imperial and Royal Government the
     duty to terminate intrigues which constitute a permanent menace
     for the peace of the monarchy.</p>

     <p>"In order to obtain this purpose, the Imperial and Royal
     Government is forced to demand official assurance from the
     Serbian Government that it condemns the propaganda directed
     against Austria-Hungary, i. e., the entirety of the machinations
     whose aim it is to separate parts from the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page367" name="page367"></a>(p. 367)</span> monarchy
     which belong to it, and that Serbia binds herself to suppress
     with all means this criminal and terrorizing propaganda.</p>

     <p>"In order to give to these obligations a solemn character, the
     Royal Serbian Government will publish on the first page of its
     official organ of July 26, 1914, the following declaration:</p>

     <p>"'The Royal Serbian Government condemns the propaganda directed
     against Austria-Hungary, i.e., the entirety of those machinations
     whose aim it is to separate from the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy
     territories belonging thereto, and she regrets sincerely the
     ghastly consequences of these criminal actions.</p>

     <p>"'The Royal Serbian Government regrets that Serbian officers and
     officials have participated in the propaganda, cited above, and
     have thus threatened the friendly and neighborly relations which
     the Royal Government was solemnly bound to cultivate by its
     declaration of March 31, 1909.</p>

     <p>"'The Royal Government, which disapproves and rejects every
     thought or every attempt at influencing the destinations of the
     inhabitants of any part of Austria-Hungary, considers it its duty
     to call most emphatically to the attention of its officers and
     officials, and of the entire population of the kingdom, that it
     will henceforward proceed with the utmost severity against any
     persons guilty of similar actions, to prevent and suppress which
     it will make every effort.'</p>

     <p>"This explanation is to be brought simultaneously to the
     cognizance of the royal army through an order of his majesty the
     king, and it is to be published in the official organ of the
     army.</p>

     <p>"The Royal Serbian Government binds itself, in addition, as
     follows:</p>

     <p>"'1. To suppress any publication which fosters hatred of, and
     contempt for, the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, and whose general
     tendency is directed against the latter's territorial integrity.</p>

     <p>"'2. To proceed at once with the dissolution of the society
     Narodna Odbrana, to confiscate their entire means of propaganda,
     and to proceed in the same manner against the other societies and
     associations in Serbia which occupy themselves with the
     propaganda against Austria-Hungary. The Royal Government will
     take the necessary measures, so that the dissolved societies may
     not continue their activities under another name or in another
     form.</p>

     <p>"'Without delay to eliminate from the public instruction in
     Serbia, so far as the corps of instructors as well as the means
     of instruction are concerned, that which serves, or may serve, to
     foster the propaganda against Austria-Hungary.</p>

     <p>"'4. To remove from military service and the administration in
     general all officers and officials who are guilty of propaganda
     against Austria-Hungary, and whose names, with a communication of
     the material which the Imperial and Royal Government possesses
     against them, the Imperial and Royal Government reserves the
     right to communicate to the Royal Government.</p>

     <p>"'5. To consent that in Serbia officials of the Imperial and
     Royal Government cooperate in the suppression of a movement
     directed against the territorial integrity of the monarchy.</p>

     <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page368" name="page368"></a>(p. 368)</span> "'6. To commence a judicial investigation against the
     participants of the conspiracy of June 28, who are on Serbian
     territory. Officials, delegated by the Imperial and Royal
     Government, will participate in the examinations.</p>

     <p>"'7. To proceed at once with all severity to arrest Major Voja
     Tankosic and a certain Milan Ciganowic, Serbian state officials,
     who have been compromised through the result of the
     investigation.</p>

     <p>"'8. To prevent through effective measures the participation of
     the Serbian authorities in the smuggling of arms and explosives
     across the frontier, and to dismiss those officials of Shabatz
     and Loznica who assisted the originators of the crime of Sarajevo
     in crossing the frontier.</p>

     <p>"'9. To give to the Imperial and Royal Government explanations in
     regard to the unjustifiable remarks of high Serbian functionaries
     in Serbia and abroad who have not hesitated, in spite of their
     official position, to express themselves in interviews in a
     hostile manner against Austria-Hungary after the outrage of June
     28.</p>

     <p>"'10. The Imperial and Royal Government expects a reply from the
     Royal Government, at the latest by Saturday, 25th inst., at 6 p.
     m. A memoir concerning the results of the investigations at
     Sarajevo, so far as they concern points 7 and 8, is inclosed with
     this note.'"</p>


     <h4>INCLOSURE</h4>

     <p>"The investigation carried on against Gabrilo Princip and
     accomplices in the court of Sarajevo, on account of the
     assassination on June 28, has so far yielded the following
     results:</p>

     <p>"'1. The plan to murder Archduke Franz Ferdinand during his stay
     in Sarajevo was conceived in Belgrade by Gabrilo Princip,
     Nedeljko, Gabrinowic, and a certain Milan Ciganowic and Trifko
     Grabez, with the aid of Major Voja Tankosic.</p>

     <p>"'2. The six bombs and four Browning pistols which were used by
     the criminals were obtained by Milan Ciganowic and Major
     Tankosic, and presented to Princip Gabrinowic in Belgrade.</p>

     <p>"'3. The bombs are hand grenades, manufactured at the arsenal of
     the Serbian army in Kragujevac.</p>

     <p>"'4. To insure the success of the assassination, Milan Ciganowic
     instructed Princip Gabrinowic in the use of the grenades and gave
     instructions in shooting with Browning pistols to Princip Grabez
     in a forest near the target practice field of Topshider (outside
     Belgrade).</p>

     <p>"'5. In order to enable the crossing of the frontier of Bosnia
     and Herzegovina by Princip Gabrinowic and Grabez, and the
     smuggling of their arms, a secret system of transportation was
     organized by Ciganowic. The entry of the criminals with their
     arms into Bosnia and Herzegovina was effected by the frontier
     captains of Shabatz (Rade Popowic) and of Loznica, as well as by
     the custom-house official Rudivoy Grbic of Loznica with the aid
     of several other persons.'"</p>
</div>

<p>On the same day that the note was presented to Serbia, July 23, 1914,
Dr. von Bethmann-Hollweg, the German Chancellor, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page369" name="page369"></a>(p. 369)</span> wrote a
circular letter to the German Ambassadors at Paris, London, and St.
Petersburg, embodying and enforcing the Austro-Hungarian arguments
justifying the note. These the ambassadors were instructed to present to
the Foreign Offices of the countries to which they were accredited. The
chancellor commended the self-restraint of Austria-Hungary in thus far
avoiding war with Serbia. Now, however, he feared that Serbia would not
comply with the just demands of the country she had injured, but would
adopt "a provocative attitude toward Austria-Hungary."</p>

     <p class="quote">"Nothing would remain for the Austro-Hungarian Government, unless
     it renounced definitely its position as a great power, but to
     press its demands with the Serbian Government, and, if need be,
     enforce the same by appeal to military measures, in regard to
     which the choice of means must be left with it."</p>

<p>The ambassadors were charged to give special emphasis to the view</p>

     <p class="quote">"that in this question there is concerned an affair which should
     be settled solely between Austria-Hungary and Serbia, the
     limitation to which it must be the earnest endeavor of the powers
     to insure. We anxiously desire the localization of the conflict
     because every intercession of another power on account of the
     various treaty alliances would precipitate inconceivable
     consequences."</p>

<p>The ambassadors were instructed by the chancellor to send him
telegraphic reports of their interviews.</p>


<h4>CONTROVERSY OVER THE TIME LIMIT</h4>

<p>The diplomatic correspondence of the two following days is occupied
chiefly with the attempt of Serbia and the powers not party to the
dispute to have the time limit of the Austro-Hungarian note extended. In
order to save repetition the correspondence hereafter will be given
under the heads of the dates when letters, telegrams, etc., were sent,
and the subheads of the countries in whose official reports they are
found.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>





<h2><span class="pagenum"><a id="page370" name="page370"></a>(p. 370)</span> CHRONOLOGICAL ARRANGEMENT OF DATES<br>

FRIDAY, JULY 24, 1914</h2>


<p><i>Serbia.</i> M. Strandtman, Russian Chargé d'Affaires at Belgrade,
telegraphed to M. Sazonof, Minister for Foreign Affairs at Petrograd,
that Pashitch, Prime Minister of Serbia, had returned to the capital,
and would give an answer to Austria within the prescribed time, showing
the points which are acceptable or unacceptable.</p>

     <p class="quote">"To-day an appeal will be addressed to the powers to defend the
     independence of Serbia. Then, added Pashitch, if war is
     inevitable, we will make war."</p>

<p><i>Great Britain.</i> Mr. Crackanthorpe, British Chargé d'Affaires at
Belgrade, telegraphed Sir Edward Grey that M. Pashitch had told him that
the Austrian demands were considered unacceptable by the Serbian
Government, and that it trusted to Great Britain to induce Austria to
moderate them. M. Pashitch was dejected and anxious.</p>

<p><i>Russia.</i> The Crown Prince Alexander, Prince Regent of Serbia,
telegraphed to Czar Nicholas II of Russia that the Serbian Government
had been willing from the first to open an inquiry in Serbia as to
complicity of Serbian subjects in the crime of Sarajevo.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"The demands contained in the Austro-Hungarian note are, however,
     unnecessarily humiliating for Serbia, and incompatible with her
     dignity as an independent state....</p>

     <p>"We are prepared to accept those of the Austro-Hungarian
     conditions which are compatible with the position of an
     independent state, as well as those to which your majesty may
     advise us to agree, and all those persons whose complicity in the
     crime may be proved will be severely punished by us. Certain of
     the demands could not be carried out without changes in our
     legislation, which would need time.... We may be attacked at the
     expiration of the time limit by the Austro-Hungarian army which
     is concentrating upon our frontier. We are unable to defend
     ourselves, and we beg your majesty to come to our aid as soon as
     possible. The much-appreciated good will which your majesty has
     so often shown toward us inspires us with the firm belief that
     once again our appeal to your noble Slav heart will not pass
     unheeded...."</p>
</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page371" name="page371"></a>(p. 371)</span> <i>Russia.</i> M. Broniewsky, Russian Chargé d'Affaires at Berlin,
telegraphed to M. Sazonof, Minister for Foreign Affairs at St.
Petersburg, that the Berlin press in the main warmly welcomed the
uncompromising attitude of Austria-Hungary.</p>

     <p class="quote">"The semiofficial 'Lokal-Anzeiger' is particularly violent; it
     describes as fruitless any possible appeals that Serbia may make
     to St. Petersburg, Paris, Athens, or Bucharest, and concludes by
     saying that the German people will breathe freely when they learn
     that the situation in the Balkan Peninsula is to be cleared up at
     last."</p>

<p><i>Serbia.</i> Dr. Spalaikovitch, Serbian Minister at St. Petersburg,
telegraphed to M. Pashitch a report of a chance interview with Count
Pourtalès, the German Ambassador. The Count had said that peace with
Austria-Hungary depended on Serbia alone, since the matter lay entirely
between the two disputants.</p>

     <p class="quote">"In reply I told Count Pourtalès that he was under a
     misapprehension, and that he would see before long that this was
     not a question merely between Serbia and Austria, but a European
     question."</p>

<p><i>Austria-Hungary.</i> Count Mensdorff, Austro-Hungarian Ambassador at
London, telegraphed to Count Berchtold, Minister for Foreign Affairs at
Vienna, that he had handed a copy of the note to Serbia to Sir Edward
Grey, British Secretary for Foreign Affairs.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"At the fifth heading he asked what it meant; to introduce
     officials of our Government in Serbia would be equivalent to the
     end of Serbian political independence. I answered that
     cooperation of, e.g., police officials, in no way affected the
     sovereignty of the state.</p>

     <p>"He regretted the time limit, as in this way we should be
     deprived of the possibility of quieting the first outbreak of
     excitement and bringing pressure to bear upon Belgrade to give us
     a satisfactory answer. It was always possible to send an
     ultimatum if answer was not satisfactory.</p>

     <p>"I developed our point of view at length. (Necessity of defense
     against continued revolutionary undertakings which threaten the
     territory of the [Dual] Monarchy, protection of our most vital
     interests, complete failure of the conciliatory attitude which we
     had hitherto often shown to Serbia, who had had more than three
     weeks to set on foot of her own accord investigations as to
     accomplices in outrage, etc.)</p>

     <p>"The Secretary of State repeated his objections to the short time
     limit, but recognized that what was said as to complicity in the
     crime of Sarajevo, as well as many of our other requirements, was
     justified.</p>

     <p>"He would be quite ready to look on the affair as one which only
     concerned Austria-Hungary and Serbia. He is, however, very
     'apprehensive' that several great powers might be involved in a
     war. Speaking of Russia, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page372" name="page372"></a>(p. 372)</span> Germany, and France, he
     observed that the terms of the Franco-Russian Alliance might be
     more or less to the same effect as those of the Triple Alliance.</p>

     <p>"I fully explained to him our point of view, and repeated with
     emphasis that in this case we must stand firm so as to gain for
     ourselves some sort of guaranties, as hitherto Serbian promises
     have never been kept. I understood that in the first place he
     considered the question only as it influences the position of
     Europe. He must, however, in order to be fair to our point of
     view, put himself in our situation.</p>

     <p>"He would not go into any more detailed discussion on this
     subject, said he must have time to study the note more carefully.
     He was to see the German and the French Ambassadors, as he must
     first of all exchange ideas with the powers who are allies of
     Austria-Hungary and Russia respectively, but have themselves no
     direct interest in Serbia."</p>
</div>

<p>Count Szécsen, Austro-Hungarian Ambassador at Paris, telegraphed to
Count Berchtold that, on his presentation of the copy of the note to
Serbia to M. Bienvenu-Martin, French Acting Secretary for Foreign
Affairs, point five in the note had seemed to make a special impression
on the secretary, since he had asked that it be reread.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"I took the opportunity to impress on him that the question was
     one which must be brought to an issue directly between Serbia and
     us, but that it was in the general interests of Europe that the
     trouble which for years past had been kept up by Serbian
     intrigues against us should at last make way for a clear
     situation.</p>

     <p>"All friends of peace and order, and I placed France in the first
     rank of these, should therefore give serious advice to Serbia to
     change completely her attitude and to satisfy our just demands.</p>

     <p>"The minister said that it was the duty of Serbia to proceed
     energetically against any accomplices of the murderers of
     Sarajevo, a duty which she could not escape. While laying special
     stress on the sympathy of France for Austria-Hungary, and on the
     good relations which existed between our two countries, he
     expressed the hope that the controversy would be brought to an
     end peacefully in a manner corresponding to our wishes.</p>

     <p>"The minister avoided every attempt to palliate or to defend in
     any way the attitude of Serbia."</p>
</div>

<p>In a second telegram Count Szécsen reported that Baron von Schoen,
German Ambassador at Paris, had officially informed M. Bienvenu-Martin,
French Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, that, in the view of the
Berlin Cabinet, the Serbian controversy concerned only the two parties
to it, and, in case that third states should wish to intervene, Germany
would be on the side of her ally. M. Bienvenu-Martin replied that his
Government <span class="pagenum"><a id="page373" name="page373"></a>(p. 373)</span> agreed that the controversy concerned Belgrade and
Vienna alone, and he hoped for a peaceful solution.</p>

<p>Count Szápáry, Austro-Hungarian Ambassador at St. Petersburg,
telegraphed to Count Berchtold that, on presenting the copy of the note
to Serbia to M. Sazonof, Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, the
minister had questioned the fact of the outrages complained of arising
in Serbia, and declared that the note was a pretext for war on Serbia.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"I said to him that no one among us was attacking the integrity
     of Serbia or the dynasty. M. Sazonof expressed himself most
     vigorously against the dissolution of the Narodna Odbrana, which
     Serbia would never undertake. The participation of imperial and
     royal officials in the suppression of the revolutionary movements
     elicited further protest on the part of the minister. Serbia then
     will no longer be master in her own house. 'You will always be
     wanting to intervene again, and what a life you will lead
     Europe!' I answered that if Serbia shows good will it will be a
     quieter life than hitherto.</p>

     <p>"The commentary added to the communication of the note was
     listened to by the minister with fair composure; at the passage
     that our feelings were shared by those of all civilized nations,
     he observed that this was a mistake. With all the emphasis I
     could command, I pointed out how regrettable it would be if we
     could not come to an understanding with Russia on this question,
     in which everything which is most sacred to us was at stake, and,
     whatever the minister might say, everything which is sacred in
     Russia. The minister attempted to minimize the monarchical side
     of the question.</p>

     <p>"With regard to the <i>dossier</i> which was put at the disposal of
     the Governments, M. Sazonof wanted to know why we had given
     ourselves this trouble, as we had already delivered the
     ultimatum. This was the best proof that we did not really desire
     an impartial examination of the matter. I said to him that the
     results which had been attained by our own investigations were
     quite sufficient for our procedure in this matter, which had to
     do with Austria-Hungary and Serbia, and that we were only ready
     to give the powers further information if it interested them, as
     we had nothing to keep secret.</p>

     <p>"M. Sazonof said that now that the ultimatum had been issued he
     was not in the least curious. He represented the matter as if we
     only wanted to make war with Serbia whatever happened. I answered
     that we were the most peace-loving power in the world, but what
     we wanted was security for our territory from foreign
     revolutionary intrigues, and the protection of our dynasty from
     bombs....</p>

     <p>"In spite of his relative calm, the attitude of the minister was
     throughout unaccommodating and hostile."</p>
</div>

<p>The Russian "Official Gazette" announced that the Government were
closely and anxiously following the Serbian controversy, to which Russia
could not remain indifferent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page374" name="page374"></a>(p. 374)</span> Count Szápáry telegraphed to Count Berchtold that, after a
council of ministers which had lasted five hours, M. Sazonof had
received the German Ambassador, Count Pourtalés.</p>

<p>M. Sazonof took the position that the Serbian question was a European
affair, the settlement of 1909 having been made under the auspices of
all the powers. He pointed out</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"that Austria-Hungary had offered a <i>dossier</i> for investigation
     when an ultimatum had already been presented. Russia would
     require an international investigation of the <i>dossier</i>, which
     had been put at her disposal. My German colleague at once brought
     to M. Sazonof's notice that Austria-Hungary would not accept
     interference in her difference with Serbia, and that Germany also
     on her side could not accept a suggestion which would be contrary
     to the dignity of her ally as a great power.</p>

     <p>"In the further course of the conversation the minister explained
     that that which Russia could not accept with indifference was the
     eventual intention of Austria-Hungary 'to devour Serbia.' Count
     Pourtalès answered that he did not accept any such intention on
     the part of Austria-Hungary, as this would be contrary to the
     most special interest of the monarchy. The only object of
     Austria-Hungary was 'to inflict on Serbia justly deserved
     chastisement.' M. Sazonof on this expressed his doubts whether
     Austria-Hungary would allow herself to be contented with this
     even if explanations on this point had been made.</p>

     <p>"The interview concluded with an appeal by M. Sazonof that
     Germany should work with Russia for the maintenance of peace. The
     German Ambassador assured the Russian Minister that Germany
     certainly had no wish to bring about a war, but that she
     naturally fully represented the interests of her ally."</p>
</div>

<p>Count Pourtalès telegraphed his Chancellor, Dr. von Bethmann-Hollweg
that M. Sazonof was very much agitated.</p>

<p>Count Berchtold telegraphed to Count Mensdorff, Austro-Hungarian
Ambassador at London, to explain to Sir Edward Grey, British Secretary
for Foreign Affairs, that the action taken toward Serbia was not a
formal ultimatum but "merely a <i>démarche</i> with a time limit," which, if
not acceded to, would be followed only by Austria's breaking off
diplomatic relations and beginning military preparations.</p>

     <p class="quote">"If Serbia were to give way only under the pressure of our
     military preparations, we should indeed have to demand that she
     should make good the expenses which we had incurred; as is well
     known, we have already had twice (1908 and 1912) to mobilize
     because of Serbia."</p>

<p>Count Berchtold telegraphed to Count Szápáry, Austro-Hungarian
Ambassador at St. Petersburg, a report of his interview <span class="pagenum"><a id="page375" name="page375"></a>(p. 375)</span> with
Prince Koudacheff, Russian Chargé d'Affaires at Vienna. The prince had
stated that St. Petersburg was apprehensive that the <i>démarche</i> might
take the form of humiliating Serbia, and this would have an echo in
Russia.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"I explained ... the danger, not only to the integrity of the
     [Dual] Monarchy, but also to the balance of power and the peace
     of Europe, which would be involved in giving further scope to the
     great Serbian propaganda, and how all the dynasties, and not
     least the Russian, would apparently be threatened if the idea
     took root that a movement which made use of murder as a national
     weapon could be continued with impunity.</p>

     <p>"I pointed out that we did not aim at any increase of territory,
     but only at the maintenance of what we possess, a point of view
     which could not fail to be understood by the Russian Government."</p>
</div>

<p><i>Russia.</i> M. Sazonof, Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, telegraphed
to Prince Koudacheff, Russian Chargé d'Affaires at Vienna, to ask Count
Berchtold, Austro-Hungarian Minister for Foreign Affairs, that the time
limit in the note to Serbia be extended, as it left to the powers
insufficient time for conciliation.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"Austria-Hungary, having declared her readiness to inform the
     powers of the results of the inquiry upon which the Imperial and
     Royal Government base their accusations, should equally allow
     them sufficient time to study them.</p>

     <p>"In this case, if the powers were convinced that certain of the
     Austrian demands were well founded, they would be in a position
     to offer advice to the Serbian Government.</p>

     <p>"A refusal to prolong the term of the ultimatum would render
     nugatory the proposals made by the Austro-Hungarian Government to
     the powers, and would be in contradiction to the very bases of
     international relations."</p>
</div>

<p>M. Sazonof communicated this message to London, Rome, Paris, and
Belgrade, with the request that in the three former cases similar
instructions be given to their Ambassadors at Vienna.</p>

<p><i>Great Britain.</i> Sir Edward Grey, British Secretary for Foreign Affairs,
telegraphed to Sir Maurice de Bunsen, British Ambassador at Vienna, that
he had said to Count Mensdorff, Austro-Hungarian Ambassador at London,
that it was a matter for great regret that a time limit, and such a
short one at that, had been insisted upon at this stage of the
proceedings.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"The murder of the archduke and some of the circumstances
     respecting Serbia quoted in the note aroused sympathy with
     Austria, as was but natural, but at the same time I had never
     before seen one state address <span class="pagenum"><a id="page376" name="page376"></a>(p. 376)</span> to another independent
     state a document of so formidable a character. Demand No. 5 would
     be hardly consistent with the maintenance of Serbia's independent
     sovereignty if it were to mean, as it seemed that it might, that
     Austria-Hungary was to be invested with a right to appoint
     officials who would have authority within the frontiers of
     Serbia.</p>

     <p>"I added that I felt great apprehension, and that I should
     concern myself with the matter simply and solely from the point
     of view of the peace of Europe. The merits of the dispute between
     Austria and Serbia were not the concern of his majesty's
     Government, and such comments as I had made above were not made
     in order to discuss those merits.</p>

     <p>"I ended by saying that doubtless we should enter into an
     exchange of views with other powers, and that I must await their
     views as to what could be done to mitigate the difficulties of
     the situation."</p>
</div>

<p>Sir George Buchanan, British Ambassador at St. Petersburg, telegraphed
to Sir Edward Grey that M. Sazonof, the Russian Minister for Foreign
Affairs, had sought an interview with him, as the Austrian step clearly
meant war. At the interview M. Sazonof had said Austria's demands were
provocative and immoral, some being impossible of acceptance. She would
never have taken such action unless Germany had first been consulted. He
hoped Great Britain would proclaim her solidarity with Russia and
France. France would fulfill the treaty obligations with Russia, besides
supporting Russia in diplomatic negotiations. Sir George said, that
personally he did not expect any declaration of this kind from Great
Britain. Direct British interests were nil in Serbia, British public
opinion would not permit Great Britain to enter war on her behalf. M.
Sazonof replied that the general European question was involved, and
Great Britain could not afford to efface herself from the problems now
at issue.</p>

<p>Evidently Sazonof wants Great Britain to join in warning Austria that
her intervention in Serbia will not be tolerated. But suppose Austria
nevertheless wars in Serbia, will Russia forthwith declare war on
Austria?</p>

<p>A council of ministers is being held this afternoon on mobilization. At
a meeting to-morrow, where the czar will preside, a decision will be
come to.</p>

<p>Sir George said the important thing to do was to influence Austria to
extend the time limit. M. Paléologue, the French <span class="pagenum"><a id="page377" name="page377"></a>(p. 377)</span> Ambassador,
was either set on war or was bluffing, and whichever it was, our only
chance for peace was to adopt a firm and united attitude. There was no
time to carry out Sir George's suggestion. The British Ambassador then
said that his Government might perhaps warn Austria that war would
probably mean Russian intervention, which would involve France and
Germany, and so make it hard for Great Britain to keep out of the
conflict. M. Sazonof answered that Great Britain would sooner or later
be dragged into war; war would be rendered more likely by Great Britain
if she did not make common cause with Russia and France. President
Poincaré and M. Viviani, President of the Council, being in Russia, it
appears as if Austria had taken advantage of their absence from France
to present their ultimatum to Serbia. Even though we do not join them it
seems that France and Russia are determined to make a strong stand.</p>

<p>Sir Maurice de Bunsen, British Ambassador at Vienna, telegraphed to Sir
Edward Grey that he was assured by M. Schebeko, Russian Ambassador at
Vienna, that Russia would not be indifferent to the humiliation of
Serbia. Prince Koudacheff, the Russian Chargé d'Affaires, had told Count
Berchtold, the Austro-Hungarian Minister for Foreign Affairs, that the
note to Serbia was unusual and peremptory, and drawn up in a form
rendering its acceptance impossible. The count replied that the
Austro-Hungarian Minister would leave Belgrade at the time set if Serbia
did not yield. The Dual Monarchy felt that its very existence was at
stake. The step taken by the Government was approved by the country. He
did not think objections would be raised by the powers.</p>

<p>Sir Edward Grey informed Sir Francis Bertie, British Ambassador at Paris
of a conversation with M. Cambon, the French Ambassador at London, over
an intended interview that afternoon of Sir Edward with Prince
Lichnowsky, the German Ambassador.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"I would say to the ambassador that, of course, if the
     presentation of this ultimatum to Serbia did not lead to trouble
     between Austria and Russia, we need not concern ourselves about
     it; but, if Russia took the view of the Austrian ultimatum, which
     it seemed to me that any power interested in Serbia would take. I
     should be quite powerless, in face of the terms of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page378" name="page378"></a>(p. 378)</span>
     ultimatum, to exercise any moderating influence. I would say that
     I thought the only chance of any mediating or moderating
     influence being exercised was that Germany, France, Italy, and
     ourselves, who had not direct interests in Serbia, should act
     together for the sake of peace, simultaneously in Vienna and St.
     Petersburg.</p>

<p>"M. Cambon said that, if there was a chance of mediation by the
     four powers, he had no doubt that his Government would be glad to
     join in it; but he pointed out that we could not say anything in
     St. Petersburg till Russia had expressed some opinion or taken
     some action. But, when two days were over, Austria would march
     into Serbia, for the Serbians could not possibly accept the
     Austrian demand. Russia would be compelled by her public opinion
     to take action as soon as Austria attacked Serbia, and therefore,
     once the Austrians had attacked Serbia, it would be too late for
     any mediation.</p>

<p>"I said that I had not contemplated anything being said in St.
     Petersburg until after it was clear that there must be trouble
     between Austria and Russia. I had thought that if Austria did
     move into Serbia, and Russia then mobilized, it would be possible
     for the four powers to urge Austria to stop her advance, and
     Russia also to stop hers, pending mediation. But it would be
     essential for any chance of success for such a step that Germany
     should participate in it.</p>

<p>"M. Cambon said that it would be too late after Austria had once
     moved against Serbia. The important thing was to gain time by
     mediation in Vienna. The best chance of this being accepted would
     be that Germany should propose it to the other powers.</p>

<p>"I said that by this he meant a mediation between Austria and
     Serbia.</p>

<p>"He replied that it was so."
</div>

<p>Sir Edward Grey telegraphed the results of the interview with Prince
Lichnowsky to Sir Horace Rumbold, British Chargé d'Affaires at Berlin.
Sir Edward's statements were those he had decided upon in his interview
with M. Cambon. The prince replied that Austria might be expected to
move unless Serbia accepted her demands <i>in toto</i>. He suggested that
Serbia ought in no case to give a negative reply. A partial acceptance
if sent at once might afford an excuse to Russia against immediate
action. Sir Edward asked Sir Horace to submit his views to the German
Secretary of State, Herr von Jagow.</p>

<p>Sir Edward Grey telegraphed Mr. Crackanthorpe, British Chargé d'Affaires
at Belgrade, to advise the Serbian Government, if it were proved that
any Serbian officials, however subordinate, were accomplices in the
murder of the archduke, to give Austria the fullest satisfaction in the
way of expressing concern with regret. For the rest they must reply as
they consider best <span class="pagenum"><a id="page379" name="page379"></a>(p. 379)</span> in Serbian interests. The only chance for
Serbia is to reply favorably to as many points in the note as the time
limit allows.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"Serbian Minister here has begged that his majesty's Government
     will express their views, but I cannot undertake responsibility
     of saying more than I have said above, and I do not like to say
     even that without knowing what is being said at Belgrade by
     French and Russian Governments. You should therefore consult your
     French and Russian colleagues as to repeating what my views are,
     as expressed above, to Serbian Government.</p>

     <p>"I have urged upon German Ambassador that Austria should not
     precipitate military action."</p>
</div>

<p><i>France.</i> M. Viviani, French Prime Minister, who had not yet seen the
note to Serbia, wrote from Reval, Russia, to M. Bienvenu-Martin, Acting
Minister for Foreign Affairs at Paris, to send on to M. Dumaine, French
Ambassador at Vienna, the following information and instructions:</p>

<p>In M. Viviani's conversation with M. Sazonof, Russian Minister of
Foreign Affairs, it was agreed to prevent Austrian intervention in the
internal affairs of Serbia of a kind which Serbia might consider as an
attack on her sovereignty and independence. This view should be
communicated to Count Berchtold, the Austro-Hungarian Minister for
Foreign Affairs, and moderation counseled him, cooperation in this
should be secured from the Russian and British Ambassadors in Vienna.
The British Ambassador, Sir George Buchanan, had informed M. Sazonof
that his Government might join in a <i>démarche</i> (proceeding) for removing
any danger to general peace, and telegraphed his Government to that
effect. M. Sazonof has instructed Count Benckendorff, Russian Ambassador
at London, to secure such cooperation. M. Paul Cambon, French Ambassador
at London, should be instructed to back him up. M. Bienvenu-Martin sent
to M. Viviani, returning from Russia on <i>La France</i>, and to the French
Ambassadors at London, Berlin, Vienna, St. Petersburg, and Rome, and the
French Minister at Belgrade, the contents of the Austrian note to
Serbia, and an account of the circumstances of the delivery of the copy
to the French Government by Count Szécsen, the Austro-Hungarian
Ambassador. M. Berthelot, French Political Director, in obedience to M.
Bienvenu-Martin's instructions, had confined himself to stating to the
ambassador <span class="pagenum"><a id="page380" name="page380"></a>(p. 380)</span> that painful feeling would be aroused in French
public opinion by the categorical nature of the note, and its short time
limit, and its presentation to Serbia at a time when the President and
Prime Minister of France were at sea, and could not exert, in
cooperation with statesmen of other powers not directly interested, that
soothing influence on Serbia and Austria which was so desirable in the
interest of general peace.</p>

<p>In a letter to these ambassadors and minister, and to the French
Minister at Stockholm (M. Thiébaut), M. Bienvenu-Martin said that M.
Berthelot, French Political Director, had advised M. Vesnitch, Serbian
Minister at Paris, that Serbia should play for delay by asking that she
be allowed time to verify the evidence, presumably one sided, adduced by
Austria in support of her note to Serbia, and, above all, that Serbia
should declare herself ready to submit to the arbitration of Europe.</p>

<p>Italy had not been consulted by Austria in regard to the note, nor even
informed of it. M. Bienvenu-Martin informed these same representatives
at foreign courts (with exception of the Ambassador at Vienna), that M.
Dumaine, French Ambassador at Vienna had reported that the chief fear of
the Austro-Hungarian military party was that Serbia would accede to the
demands of Austria-Hungary; and that M. Yov. Yovanovitch, Serbian
Minister at Vienna thought his Government would give way on all points
save the order to the army dictated to King Peter, dismissal of officers
suspected by Austria, and interference by foreign officials in Serbia.
M. Yovanovitch hoped that a discussion on these points might be started
which would lead to arbitration by the powers.</p>

<p>The feeling in Germany was warlike. The tone of the press there was
intimidating, particularly toward Russia. Italy was exercising
moderating influence at Vienna.</p>

<p>M. Bienvenu-Martin notified the French representatives at the above
courts and at Vienna of the contents of the circular note of the German
Government delivered him that day by Baron von Schoen, the German
Ambassador. Said the Acting Foreign Secretary:</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page381" name="page381"></a>(p. 381)</span> "I called the German Ambassador's attention to the fact
     that while it might appear legitimate to demand the punishment of
     all those who were implicated in the crime of Sarajevo, on the
     other hand it seemed difficult to require measures which could
     not be accepted, having regard to the dignity and sovereignty of
     Serbia; the Serbian Government, even if it was willing to submit
     to them, would risk being carried away by a revolution.</p>

     <p>"I also pointed out to Herr von Schoen that his note only took
     into account two hypotheses: that of a pure and simple refusal or
     that of a provocative attitude on the part of Serbia. The third
     hypothesis (which would leave the door open for an arrangement)
     should also be taken into consideration; that of Serbia's
     acceptance and of her agreeing at once to give full satisfaction
     for the punishment of the accomplices and full guaranties for the
     suppression of the anti-Austrian propaganda so far as they were
     compatible with her sovereignty and dignity.</p>

     <p>"I added that if within these limits the satisfaction desired by
     Austria could be admitted, the means of obtaining it could be
     examined; if Serbia gave obvious proof of good will it could not
     be thought that Austria would refuse to take part in the
     conversation.</p>

     <p>"Perhaps they should not make it too difficult for third powers,
     who could not either morally or sentimentally cease to take
     interest in Serbia, to take an attitude which was in accord with
     the wishes of Germany to localize the dispute.</p>

     <p>"Herr von Schoen recognized the justice of these considerations
     and vaguely stated that hope was always possible. When I asked
     him if we should give to the Austrian note the character of a
     simple <i>mise en demeure</i>, which permitted a discussion, or an
     ultimatum, he answered that personally he had no views."</p>
</div>

<p>M. Jules Cambon, French Ambassador at Berlin, reported to M.
Bienvenu-Martin, that official German opinion supported Austria in not
abating her demands on Serbia. There was pessimism in diplomatic
circles. The Russian Chargé d'Affaires, M. Broniewsky, had bitterly
noted the presentation of the note to Serbia during the absence from
France of the French President and Prime Minister. He thought that
William II, in his desire to support the monarchic principle, was
becoming less inclined to show a conciliatory attitude.</p>

<p>In a second letter M. Cambon reported an interview he had just had with
Herr von Jagow, German Secretary of State. The secretary supported the
Austrian note to Serbia. It was that country's domestic affair, and he
hoped that the dispute would be localized.</p>

<a id="img022" name="img022"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img022.jpg" width="400" height="639" alt="" title="">
<p>King Peter of Serbia.</p></div>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"I asked him if the Berlin Cabinet had really been entirely
     ignorant of Austria's requirements before they were communicated
     to Belgrade, and as <span class="pagenum"><a id="page382" name="page382"></a>(p. 382)</span> he told me that that was so, I
     showed him my surprise at seeing him thus undertake to support
     claims of whose limit and scope he was ignorant.</p>

<p>"Herr von Jagow interrupted me, and said: 'It is only because we
     are having a personal conversation that I allow you to say that
     to me.'</p>

<p>"'Certainly,' I replied, 'but if Peter I humiliates himself,
     domestic trouble will probably break out in Serbia; that will
     open the door to fresh possibilities, and do you know where you
     will be led by Vienna?' I added that the language of the German
     newspapers was not the language of persons who were indifferent
     to, and unacquainted with, the question, but betokened an active
     support. Finally I remarked that the shortness of the time limit
     given to Serbia for submission would make an unpleasant
     impression in Europe.</p>

<p>"Herr von Jagow answered that he quite expected a little
     excitement (<i>un peu d'émotion</i>) on the part of Serbia's friends,
     but that he was counting on their giving her wise advice.</p>

<p>"'I have no doubt,' I then said to him, 'that Russia would
     endeavor to persuade the Cabinet of Belgrade to make acceptable
     concessions; but why not ask from one what is being asked from
     the other, and if reliance is being placed on advice being given
     at Belgrade, is it not also legitimate to rely on advice being
     given at Vienna from another quarter?'</p>

<p>"The Secretary of State went so far as to say that that depended
     on circumstances; but immediately checked himself; he repeated
     that the difficulty must be localized. He asked me if I really
     thought the situation serious. 'Certainly,' I answered, 'because
     if what is happening is the result of due reflection, I do not
     understand why all means of retreat have been cut off.'</p>

<p>"All the evidence shows that Germany is ready to support
     Austria's attitude with unusual energy. The weakness which her
     Austro-Hungarian ally has shown for some years past has weakened
     the confidence that was placed in her here. She was found heavy
     to drag along. Mischievous legal proceedings, such as the Agram
     and the Friedjung affairs, brought odium on her police and
     covered them with ridicule. All that was asked of the police was
     that they should be strong; the conviction is that they were
     violent.</p>

<p>"An article which appeared in the 'Lokal Anzeiger' this evening
     shows also that at the German Chancellery there exists a state of
     mind to which we in Paris are naturally not inclined to pay
     sufficient attention, I mean the feeling that monarchies must
     stand together. I am convinced that great weight must be attached
     to this point of view in order to appreciate the attitude of the
     Emperor William, whose impressionable nature must have been
     affected by the assassination of a prince whose guest he had been
     a few days previously.</p>

<p>"It is not less striking to notice the pains with which Herr von
     Jagow, and all the officials placed under his orders, pretend to
     everyone that they were ignorant of the scope of the note sent by
     Austria to Serbia."</p>
</div>

<p>M. Paléologue, French Ambassador at St. Petersburg, reported to M.
Bienvenu-Martin as follows:</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"The intentions of the Emperor of Russia and his ministers could
     not be more pacific, a fact of which the President of the
     [French] Republic and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page383" name="page383"></a>(p. 383)</span> the president of the council have
     been able to satisfy themselves directly; but the ultimatum which
     the Austro-Hungarian Government has just delivered to the Cabinet
     at Belgrade introduces a new and disquieting element into the
     situation.</p>

     <p>"Public opinion in Russia would not allow Austria to offer
     violence to Serbia. The shortness of the time limit fixed by the
     ultimatum renders still more difficult the moderating influence
     that the powers of the Triple Entente might exercise at Vienna.</p>

     <p>"On the other hand, M. Sazonof [Russian Prime Minister] assumes
     that Germany will desire to support her ally and I am afraid that
     this impression is correct. Nothing but the assurance of the
     solidarity of the Triple Entente can prevent the German powers
     from emphasizing their provocative attitude."</p>
</div>

<p>M. Paul Cambon, French Ambassador at London, reported to M.
Bienvenu-Martin an interview with Sir Edward Grey, British Secretary for
Foreign Affairs. Cambon and Grey were agreed that everything must be
done to avert the crisis, and that the British Cabinet should take the
initiative in offering mediation by the four powers not directly
interested, Great Britain, France, Russia and Germany. If Germany
assented, time would be gained, and this was the essential point.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"Sir Edward Grey told me that he would discuss with Prince
     Lichnowsky the proposal. I mentioned the matter to my Russian
     colleague [Count Benckendorff] who is afraid of a surprise from
     Germany, and who imagines that Austria would not have dispatched
     her ultimatum without previous agreement with Berlin.</p>

     <p>"Count Benckendorff told me that Prince Lichnowsky, when he
     returned from leave about a month ago, had intimated that he held
     pessimistic views regarding the relations between St. Petersburg
     and Berlin. He had observed the uneasiness caused in this latter
     capital by the rumors of a naval entente between Russia and Great
     Britain, by the czar's visit to Bucharest, and by the
     strengthening of the Russian army. Count Benckendorff had
     concluded from this that a war with Russia would be looked upon
     without disfavor in Germany.</p>

     <p>"The Under-Secretary of State [Sir Arthur Nicholson] has been
     struck, as all of us have been, by the anxious looks of Prince
     Lichnowsky since his return from Berlin, and he considers that if
     Germany had wished to do so she could have stopped the dispatch
     of the ultimatum.</p>

     <p>"The situation, therefore, is as grave as it can be, and we see
     no way of arresting the course of events.</p>

     <p>"However, Count Benckendorff thinks it right to attempt the
     démarche upon which I have agreed with Sir Edward Grey."</p>
</div>

<p>In a second letter M. Cambon reported receipt of the details of the
Austrian ultimatum.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page384" name="page384"></a>(p. 384)</span> "In consultation with my Russian colleague, who thinks
     it extremely difficult for his Government not to support Serbia,
     we have been asking ourselves what intervention could avert the
     conflict.</p>

     <p>"Sir Edward Grey having summoned me for this afternoon, I propose
     to suggest that he should ask for the semiofficial intervention
     of the German Government at Vienna to prevent a sudden attack."</p>
</div>

<p>M. Bienvenu-Martin informed the French Ambassadors at St. Petersburg,
Berlin, Vienna and Rome, and the Ministers at Stockholm and Belgrade of
M. Cambon's report, and his (Bienvenu-Martin's) willingness to cooperate
in the proposed conciliatory action at Vienna.</p>

<p><i>Belgium.</i> M. Davignon, Belgian Minister for Foreign Affairs, notified
the Belgian Ministers at Paris, London, Berlin, Vienna, and St.
Petersburg</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"that the Government had under consideration an address to the
     powers who guarantee Belgian independence and neutrality assuring
     them of Belgium's determination to fulfill the international
     obligations imposed upon her by treaty in the event of a war
     breaking out on her frontiers.</p>

     <p>"The Government have come to the conclusion that such a
     communication would be premature at present, but that events
     might move rapidly and not leave sufficient time to forward
     suitable instructions at the desired moment to the Belgian
     representatives abroad.</p>

     <p>"In these circumstances I have proposed to the King [Albert] and
     to my colleagues in the Cabinet, who have concurred, to give you
     now exact instructions as to the steps to be taken by you if the
     prospect of a Franco-German war became more threatening.</p>

     <p>"I inclose herewith a note, signed but not dated, which you
     should read to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and of which you
     should give him a copy, if circumstances render such a
     communication necessary.</p>

     <p>"I shall inform you by telegram when you are to act on these
     instructions.</p>

     <p>"This telegram will be dispatched when the order is given for the
     mobilization of the Belgian army if, contrary to our earnest hope
     and to the apparent prospect of a peaceful settlement, our
     information leads us to take this extreme measure of precaution."</p>
</div>

<p>The note inclosed said that Belgium had "most scrupulously" observed the
obligations of neutrality imposed on her by the treaties of April 19,
1839, and would "strive unflinchingly" to fulfill them whatever the new
circumstances might be.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"The friendly feelings of the powers toward her have been so
     often reaffirmed that Belgium confidently expects that her
     territory will remain free from any attack, should hostilities
     break out upon her frontiers.</p>

     <p>"All necessary steps to insure respect of Belgian neutrality have
     nevertheless been taken by the Government. The Belgian army has
     been mobilized <span class="pagenum"><a id="page385" name="page385"></a>(p. 385)</span> and is taking up such strategic
     positions as have been chosen to secure the defense of the
     country and the respect of its neutrality. The forts of Antwerp
     and on the Meuse have been put in a state of defense....</p>

     <p>"These measures are intended solely to enable Belgium to fulfill
     her international obligations; and it is obvious that they
     neither have been nor can have been undertaken with any intention
     of taking part in an armed struggle between the powers or from
     any feeling of distrust of any of those powers."</p>
</div>

<p>On the following day this notification was also sent to the Belgian
Ministers at Rome, The Hague, and Luxemburg.</p>


<h3>SATURDAY, JULY 25, 1914</h3>

<p><i>Austria-Hungary.</i> Count Berchtold, Austro-Hungarian Minister for
Foreign Affairs, telegraphed from Lembach to his Under-Secretary, Baron
von Macchio, that Russia through Prince Koudacheff, its Chargé
d'Affaires at Vienna, was pressing for an extension of the time limit in
the note to Serbia, and that he should tell the prince this would not be
granted, but that, even after the severance of diplomatic relations,
Serbia could have peace by complying unconditionally with
Austria-Hungary's demands&mdash;in which case, however, she must pay the cost
of Austro-Hungarian military measures.</p>

<p>Later, Count Berchtold telegraphed to Count Szápáry, Austro-Hungarian
Ambassador at St. Petersburg, that Prince Koudacheff had based his
request on the powers being taken by surprise in the demands on Serbia,
and therefore that Russia should have time to consider the evidence in
the case as presented in Austria-Hungary's <i>dossier</i>. These grounds,
said Count Berchtold, rested on a mistaken hypothesis.</p>

     <p class="quote">"Our note to the powers was in no way intended to invite them to
     make known their own views on the subject, but merely bore the
     character of a statement for information, the communication of
     which we regarded as a duty laid on us by international
     courtesy.... We regarded our action as concerning us and Serbia
     alone."</p>

<p>Baron Giesl von Gieslingen, Austro-Hungarian Minister at Belgrade,
telegraphed Count Berchtold that the Serbian Cabinet on the evening of
the 24th and morning of the 25th had been preparing its reply to the
note, and would deliver it before the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page386" name="page386"></a>(p. 386)</span> time limit expired;
preparations were being made by the Serbian Government and army for
removal into the interior; foreign legations expected to have to follow;
the Russian Legation was already packing up; the Austro-Hungarian
Legation were ready to leave Belgrade by the 6.30 p. m. train.</p>

<p>Count Berchtold notified Count Szápáry at St. Petersburg, on the same
day, that, in case of Russia reconsidering her position, and refusing to
be swept away by the bellicose elements, he, with the support of his
German colleague, Count Pourtalès, a close understanding with whom was
presumed, should impress upon M. Sazonof, the Russian Minister for
Foreign Affairs, that Austria-Hungary, in event of war with Russia,
would not stand alone.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"That we had striven up till now, so far as in us lay, to
     preserve the peace which we considered to be the most precious
     possession of nations, was shown by the course of events during
     the last forty years, and by the historical fact that our
     gracious emperor has won for himself the glorious title of
     'Protector of the Peace.'</p>

     <p>"We should, therefore, most sincerely deplore the disturbance of
     the European peace, because we also were of the opinion that the
     strengthening of the Balkan States in a position of political and
     national independence would prove to the advantage of our
     relations with Russia, and would also remove all possibility of
     antagonism between us and Russia; also because we have always
     been ready, in the shaping of our own policy, to take into
     consideration the dominant political interests of Russia.</p>

     <p>"Any further toleration of Serbian intrigues would undermine our
     existence as a state and our position as a great power, thus also
     threatening the balance of power in Europe. We are, however,
     convinced that it is to Russia's own interests, as her peaceful
     leaders will clearly see, that the existing European balance of
     power which is of such importance for the peace of the world,
     should be maintained. Our action against Serbia, whatever form it
     takes, is conservative from first to last, and its object is the
     necessary preservation of our position in Europe."</p>
</div>

<p>In a supplementary telegram Count Berchtold instructed Count Szápáry to
explain that point five in the note to Serbia was interpolated merely
out of practical considerations, and not to infringe on the sovereignty
of Serbia.</p>

     <p class="quote">"By 'collaboration' in point five, we are thinking of the
     establishment of a private 'Bureau de Sûreté' at Belgrade, which
     would operate in the same way as the analogous Russian
     establishments in Paris and in cooperation with the Serbian
     police and administration."</p>

<p>Other ambassadors were similarly instructed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page387" name="page387"></a>(p. 387)</span> <i>Russia.</i> M. Broniewsky, Russian Chargé d'Affaires at Berlin,
telegraphed to M. Sazonof reporting that he and the British Ambassador,
Sir George Buchanan, had urged the German Secretary of State, Herr von
Jagow, to advise Vienna to extend the time limit in the ultimatum to
Serbia. Von Jagow had telegraphed the request to Vienna, but, owing to
the absence of Count Berchtold from the capital, feared that it would
have no result.</p>

     <p class="quote">"Moreover, he has doubts as to the wisdom of Austria yielding at
     the last moment, and he is inclined to think that such a step on
     her part might increase the assurance of Serbia. I replied that a
     great power such as Austria could give way without impairing her
     prestige, and I adduced every other similar argument, but failed,
     nevertheless, to obtain any more definite promise. Even when I
     gave him to understand that action must be taken at Vienna if the
     possibility of terrible consequences was to be avoided, the
     Minister for Foreign Affairs answered each time in the negative."</p>

<p>M. Sevastipoulo, Russian Chargé d'Affaires at Paris, telegraphed M.
Sazonof that, at his instance, the French representative at Vienna had
been instructed to request extension of the time limit in the note to
Serbia.</p>

<p>Count Benckendorff, Russian Ambassador at London, telegraphed that the
British representative at Vienna had been instructed to do the same, and
also to discuss the prevention of hostilities should the request be
refused.</p>

<p>M. Sazonof replied by telegraph that in event of hostilities, Russia
counted on Great Britain siding at once and definitely with France and
Russia in order to maintain the European balance of power for which
Great Britain had constantly intervened in the past and which would
certainly be compromised by the triumph of Austria.</p>

<p>Count Pourtalès, German Ambassador at St. Petersburg, handed a note
<i>verbale</i> to M. Sazonof, denying the press report that the action of
Austria-Hungary was instigated by the German Government, and declaring
that this government "had no knowledge of the text" of the note to
Serbia before it was presented, and had "exercised no influence upon its
contents."</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"Germany, as the ally of Austria, naturally supports the claims
     made by the Vienna Cabinet against Serbia, which she considers
     justified.</p>

     <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page388" name="page388"></a>(p. 388)</span> "Above all Germany wishes, as she has already declared
     from the very beginning of the Austro-Serbian dispute, that this
     conflict should be localized."</p>
</div>

<p>The same statement was made to the French Government by Baron von
Schoen, the German Ambassador, and to the British Government by Count
Benckendorff, the Russian Ambassador. The count asked Sir Edward Grey,
British Secretary of Foreign Affairs, that the British Government bring
conciliatory pressure on Austria.</p>

     <p class="quote">"Grey replied that this was quite impossible. He added that, as
     long as complications existed between Austria and Serbia alone,
     British interests were only indirectly affected; but he had to
     look ahead to the fact that Austrian mobilization would lead to
     Russian mobilization, and that from that moment a situation would
     exist in which the interests of all the powers would be involved.
     In that event Great Britain reserved to herself full liberty of
     action."</p>

<p><i>Great Britain.</i> Sir Francis Bertie, British Ambassador at Paris,
telegraphed to Sir Edward Grey that M. Bienvenu-Martin, French Acting
Minister for Foreign Affairs, hoped that Serbia's reply to
Austra-Hungary's demands would be sufficiently conciliatory to obviate
extreme measures, but said that there would be revolution in Serbia if
she were to accept the demands in their entirety.</p>

<p>Sir George Buchanan, British Ambassador at St. Petersburg, telegraphed
to Sir Edward Grey that M. Sazonof, Russian Minister for Foreign
Affairs, said that the explanations of the Austrian Ambassador, Count
Szápáry, did not quite correspond with information received from German
quarters, which information came too late to affect negotiations at
Vienna.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"The Minister for Foreign Affairs said that Serbia was quite
     ready to do as you had suggested and to punish those proved to be
     guilty, but that no independent State could be expected to accept
     the political demands which had been put forward. The Minister
     for Foreign Affairs thought, from a conversation which he had
     with the Serbian Minister [Dr. Spalaikovitch] yesterday, that, in
     the event of the Austrians attacking Serbia, the Serbian
     Government would abandon Belgrade, and withdraw their forces into
     the interior, while they would at the same time appeal to the
     powers to help them. His excellency was in favor of their making
     this appeal. He would like to see the question placed on an
     international footing, as the obligations taken by Serbia in
     1908, to which reference is made in the Austrian ultimatum, were
     given not to Austria, but to the powers.</p>

     <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page389" name="page389"></a>(p. 389)</span> "If Serbia should appeal to the powers, Russia would be
     quite ready to stand aside and leave the question in the hands of
     England, France, Germany, and Italy. It was possible, in his
     opinion, that Serbia might propose to submit the question to
     arbitration.</p>

     <p>"On my expressing the earnest hope that Russia would not
     precipitate war by mobilizing until you had had time to use your
     influence in favor of peace, his excellency assured me that
     Russia had no aggressive intentions, and she would take no action
     until it was forced upon her. Austria's action was in reality
     directed against Russia. She aimed at overthrowing the present
     <i>status quo</i> in the Balkans, and establishing her own hegemony
     there. He did not believe that Germany really wanted war, but her
     attitude was decided by ours. If we took our stand firmly with
     France and Russia there would be no war. If we failed them now,
     rivers of blood would flow, and we would in the end be dragged
     into war.</p>

     <p>"I said that England could play the rôle of mediator at Berlin
     and Vienna to better purpose as friend who, if her counsels of
     moderation were disregarded, might one day be converted into an
     ally, than if she were to declare herself Russia's ally at once.
     His excellency said that unfortunately Germany was convinced that
     she could count upon our neutrality.</p>

     <p>"I said all I could to impress prudence on the Minister for
     Foreign Affairs, and warned him that if Russia mobilized, Germany
     would not be content with mere mobilization, or give Russia time
     to carry out hers, but would probably declare war at once. His
     excellency replied that Russia could not allow Austria to crush
     Serbia and become the predominant power in the Balkans, and, if
     she feels secure of the support of France, she will face all the
     risks of war."</p>
</div>

<p>Sir Horace Rumbold, British Chargé d'Affaires at Berlin, telegraphed to
Sir Edward Grey that Herr von Jagow, German Secretary of State, had
instructed the German Ambassador at Vienna, Herr von Tschirscky, to
present to Count Berchtold, Austro-Hungarian Minister for Foreign
Affairs, Grey's suggestion of an extension of the time limit for
Serbia's reply, but that, owing to Berchtold's absence from the capital,
the extension would probably not be granted. Von Jagow did not know what
Austria-Hungary had ready on the spot, but admitted that they meant to
take military action. He also admitted that Serbia "could not swallow"
certain of Austria-Hungary's demands.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"I asked whether it was not to be feared that, in taking military
     action against Serbia, Austria would dangerously excite public
     opinion in Russia. He said he thought not. He remained of opinion
     that crisis could be localized. I said that telegrams from Russia
     in this morning's papers did not look very reassuring, but he
     maintained his optimistic view with regard to Russia. He said
     that he had given the Russian Government to understand <span class="pagenum"><a id="page390" name="page390"></a>(p. 390)</span>
     that the last thing Germany wanted was a general war, and he
     would do all in his power to prevent such a calamity. If the
     relations between Austria and Russia became threatening, he was
     quite ready to fall in with your suggestion as to the four powers
     working in favor of moderation at Vienna and St. Petersburg.</p>

     <p>"Secretary of State confessed privately that he thought the note
     left much to be desired as a diplomatic document. He repeated
     very earnestly that, though he had been accused of knowing all
     about the contents of that note, he had in fact had no such
     knowledge."</p>
</div>

<p>Sir Rennell Rodd, British Ambassador at Rome, telegraphed to Sir Edward
Grey that the Italian Secretary General was of opinion that Austria will
only be restrained by Serbia's unconditional surrender, and that there
was reliable information she intended to seize the Saloniki Railway.</p>

<p>Sir Maurice de Bunsen, British Ambassador at Vienna, telegraphed Sir
Edward Grey that the language of the Vienna press left the impression
that the surrender of Serbia was neither expected nor desired, and that
Minister for Foreign Affairs Berchtold would go to Ischl to communicate
Serbia's reply as soon as it was presented.</p>

<p>Mr. Crackanthorpe, British Chargé d'Affaires at Belgrade, telegraphed to
Sir Edward Grey a forecast of the Serbian reply, and said that the
Serbian Government considered it would be fully satisfactory unless
Austria-Hungary was determined on war at any cost. In a supplementary
telegram he said that in view of his French and Russian colleagues not
having received instructions from their governments and of the proposed
conciliatory terms of the Serbian reply, he had not offered advice to
the Serbian Government. It was highly probable the Russian Government
had urged the utmost moderation on Serbia.</p>

<p>Sir Edward Grey telegraphed Sir George Buchanan, British Ambassador at
St. Petersburg, that he could not promise to Russia more than he had
done.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"I do not consider that public opinion here would or ought to
     sanction our going to war over a Serbian quarrel. If, however,
     war does take place, the development of other issues may draw us
     into it, and I am therefore anxious to prevent it.</p>

     <p>"The sudden, brusque, and peremptory character of the Austrian
     <i>démarche</i> makes it almost inevitable that in a very short time
     both Russia and Austria will have mobilized against each other.
     In this event, the only <span class="pagenum"><a id="page391" name="page391"></a>(p. 391)</span> chance of peace, in my opinion,
     is for the other four powers to join in asking the Austrian and
     Russian Governments not to cross the frontier, and to give time
     for the four powers acting at Vienna and St. Petersburg to try
     and arrange matters. If Germany will adopt this view, I feel
     strongly that France and ourselves should act upon it. Italy
     would no doubt gladly cooperate.</p>

     <p>"No diplomatic intervention or mediation would be tolerated by
     either Russia or Austria unless it was clearly impartial and
     included the allies or friends of both. The cooperation of
     Germany would, therefore, be essential."</p>
</div>

<p>Sir Edward Grey telegraphed to Sir Horace Rumbold, British Chargé
d'Affaires at Berlin, to the same effect, and also that Prince
Lichnowsky, German Ambassador at London, was personally favorable to the
suggestion of mediation between Austria and Russia, which he thought
Austria might be able with dignity to accept.</p>

     <p class="quote">"I impressed upon the ambassador that, in the event of Russian
     and Austrian mobilization, the participation of Germany would be
     essential to any diplomatic action for peace. Alone we could do
     nothing. The French Government were traveling at the moment, and
     I had had no time to consult them, and could not therefore be
     sure of their views, but I was prepared, if the German Government
     agreed with my suggestion, to tell the French Government that I
     thought it the right thing to act upon it."</p>

<p>Sir Edward Grey telegraphed to Sir Maurice de Bunsen, British Ambassador
at Vienna, the text of the Russian telegram sent to the Russian
Ambassador at Vienna asking the Austro-Hungarian Government for
extension of the time limit for the Serbian reply, and protesting that a
refusal would be "against international ethics." Grey asked Bunsen to
support the Russian position.</p>

     <p class="quote">"I trust that if the Austro-Hungarian Government consider it too
     late to prolong the time limit, they will at any rate give time
     in the sense and for the reasons desired by Russia before taking
     any irretrievable steps."</p>

<p>Sir Edward Grey telegraphed Mr. Crackanthorpe, British Chargé d'Affaires
at Belgrade, an account of an interview of M. Boschkovitch, Serbian
Minister at London, with Sir Arthur Nicholson, British Under-Secretary
of Foreign Affairs.</p>

     <p class="quote">"He mentioned that both the assassins of the archduke were
     Austrian subjects&mdash;Bosniaks; that one of them had been in Serbia,
     and that the Serbian authorities, considering him suspect and
     dangerous, had desired to expel him, but on applying to the
     Austrian authorities found that the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page392" name="page392"></a>(p. 392)</span> latter protected
     him, and said that he was an innocent and harmless individual."</p>

<p><i>France.</i>&mdash;M. Jules Cambon, French Ambassador at Berlin, reported to M.
Bienvenu-Martin, Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs at Paris, an
interview with Baron Beyens, Belgian Minister at Berlin.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"The Belgian Minister appears very anxious.... He is of opinion
     that Austria and Germany have desired to take advantage of the
     fact that, owing to a combination of circumstances at the present
     moment, Russia and England appear to them to be threatened by
     domestic troubles, while in France the state of the army is under
     discussion. Moreover, he does not believe in the pretended
     ignorance of the Government of Berlin on the subject of Austria's
     <i>démarche</i>.</p>

     <p>"He thinks that, if the form of it has not been submitted to the
     Cabinet at Berlin, the moment of its dispatch has been cleverly
     chosen in consultation with that Cabinet, in order to surprise
     the Triple Entente at a moment of disorganization.</p>

     <p>"He has seen the Italian Ambassador, who has just interrupted his
     holiday in order to return. It looks as if Italy would be
     surprised, to put it no higher, at having been kept out of the
     whole affair by her two Allies."</p>
</div>

<p>M. Bienvenu-Martin notified the French Legations at London, Berlin, St.
Petersburg, Vienna, and Stockholm of a visit made him by Baron von
Schoen, the German Ambassador, to protest against an article in the
<i>Écho de Paris</i> calling his <i>démarche</i> of yesterday a "German threat."
M. Berthelot, French Political Director, assured him that no private
information had been given out by the Foreign office of the <i>démarche</i>,
and that the article merely showed that the proceeding was known
elsewhere than at the Quai d'Orsay. The German Ambassador did not take
up the allusion.</p>

<p>M. Paléologue, French Ambassador at St. Petersburg, reported to M.
Bienvenu-Martin that M. Sazonof, Russian Secretary for Foreign Affairs,
had been unfavorably impressed by the evasive replies and recriminations
of Count de Pourtalès, the German Ambassador, over the note to Serbia.</p>

     <p class="quote">"The ministers will hold a council to-morrow with the czar
     presiding. M. Sazonof preserves complete moderation. 'We must
     avoid,' he said to me, 'everything which might precipitate the
     crisis. I am of opinion that, even if the Austro-Hungarian
     Government come to blows with Serbia, we ought not to break off
     negotiations.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page393" name="page393"></a>(p. 393)</span> M. Jules Cambon, French Ambassador at Berlin, reported to M.
Bienvenu-Martin the interview with Herr von Jagow, German Secretary of
State, by Sir Horace Rumbold.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"The British Chargé d'Affaires inquired of Herr von Jagow, as I
     had done yesterday, if Germany had had no knowledge of the
     Austrian note before it was dispatched, and he received so clear
     a reply in the negative that he was not able to carry the matter
     further; but he could not refrain from expressing his surprise at
     the blank cheque given by Germany to Austria.</p>

     <p>"Herr von Jagow having replied to him that the matter was a
     domestic one for Austria, he remarked that it had become
     essentially an international one."</p>
</div>

<p>Later in the day M. Cambon reported the interview between Herr von Jagow
and M. Broniewski, Russian Chargé d'Affaires at Berlin.</p>

     <p class="quote">"M. Broniewski, like myself, has heard the rumor that Austria,
     while declaring that she did not desire an annexation of
     territory, would occupy parts of Serbia until she had received
     complete satisfaction. 'One knows,' he said to me, 'what this
     word "satisfaction" means.' M. Broniewski's impressions of
     Germany's ultimate intentions are very pessimistic."</p>

<p>M. Dumaine, French Ambassador at Vienna, reported to M. Bienvenu-Martin
that Prince Koudacheff, Russian Chargé d'Affaires, had sent his
Government's request of an extension of the time limit for the Serbian
reply to Count Berchtold, the Austro-Hungarian Minister for Foreign
Affairs, in two telegrams, one addressed to him on his journey, and the
other to Ischl, his destination. The prince does not expect any result.
Baron Macchio, General Secretary of the Austro-Hungarian Foreign Office,
had received "with icy coldness" the prince's expostulation that the
submission by Austria-Hungary of grievances against Serbia without
permitting time for their examination was not consonant with
international courtesy. The baron replied that one's interests sometimes
exempted one from being courteous.</p>

     <p class="quote">"The Austrian Government is determined to inflict humiliation on
     Serbia: it will accept no intervention from any power until the
     blow has been delivered and received full in the face by Serbia."</p>

<p>M. Barrère, French Ambassador at Rome, reported to M. Bienvenu-Martin
that the request by the Russian Government <span class="pagenum"><a id="page394" name="page394"></a>(p. 394)</span> for Italy's
cooperation in securing from Austria-Hungary an extension of the time
limit for the Serbian reply, came too late for action thereon, owing to
the absence from Rome of the Prime Minister, the Marquis di San
Giuliano.</p>

<p>M. Jules Cambon, French Ambassador at Berlin, notified M.
Bienvenu-Martin that report had come from Vienna of rupture between
Austria-Hungary and Serbia.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"Large crowds consisting of several hundred persons are
     collecting here before the newspaper offices and a demonstration
     of numbers of young people has just passed through the
     Pariser-platz shouting cries of 'Hurrah' for Germany, and singing
     patriotic songs. The demonstrators are visiting the <i>Siegessaül</i>
     [column of victory], the Austrian and then the Italian Embassy.
     It is a significant outburst of chauvinism....</p>

     <p>"In financial circles measures are already being taken to meet
     every eventuality, for no means of averting the crisis is seen,
     in view of the determined support which Germany is giving to
     Austria.</p>

     <p>"I, for my part, see in Great Britain the only power which might
     be listened to at Berlin.</p>

     <p>"Whatever happens, Paris, St. Petersburg, and London will not
     succeed in maintaining peace with dignity unless they show a firm
     and absolutely united front."</p>
</div>

<p>At the hour of expiration of the ultimatum to Serbia, M. Dumaine, French
Ambassador at Vienna, reported to M. Bienvenu-Martin that Prince
Koudacheff, the Russian Chargé d'Affaires, had presented alone his
request for an extension of the time limit, it seeming to the
representatives of the other powers useless to support him when there
was no time to do so.</p>

     <p class="quote">"At the last moment we are assured that the Austrian Minister has
     just left Belgrade hurriedly; he must have thought the Serbian
     Government's acceptance of the conditions imposed by his
     Government inadequate."</p>


<h4>SERBIA'S REPLY TO THE AUSTRO-HUNGARIAN NOTE</h4>

<p>A few minutes before 6 p. m., July 25, 1914, the Serbian Government made
its reply to the Austrian note.</p>

<p>This declared that no attempts had been made, or declarations uttered,
by responsible representatives of Serbia, tending to subvert
Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina, since March 31, 1909,
when protests against the annexation of these <span class="pagenum"><a id="page395" name="page395"></a>(p. 395)</span> countries made
in the Skupshtina (Serbian Parliament) were cut short by declarations of
the Serbian Government. It drew attention to the fact that
Austria-Hungary had since then made no complaint in this connection save
in regard to a school book, concerning which it had received an entirely
satisfactory explanation.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"Serbia has several times given proofs of her pacific and
     moderate policy during the Balkan crisis, and it is thanks to
     Serbia and to the sacrifice that she has made in the exclusive
     interest of European peace that that peace has been preserved.
     The Royal Government cannot be held responsible for
     manifestations of a private character, such as articles in the
     press and the peaceable work of societies&mdash;manifestations which
     take place in nearly all countries in the ordinary course of
     events, and which, as a general rule, escape official control.
     The Royal Government are all the less responsible, in view of the
     fact that at the time of the solution of a series of questions
     which arose between Serbia and Austria-Hungary they gave proof of
     a great readiness to oblige, and thus succeeded in settling the
     majority of these questions to the advantage of the two
     neighboring countries.</p>

     <p>"For these reasons the Royal Government have been pained and
     surprised at the statements, according to which members of the
     Kingdom of Serbia are supposed to have participated in the
     preparations for the crime committed at Sarajevo; the Royal
     Government expected to be invited to collaborate in an
     investigation of all that concerns this crime, and they were
     ready, in order to prove the entire correctness of their
     attitude, to take measures against any persons concerning whom
     representations were made to them. Falling in, therefore, with
     the desire of the Imperial and Royal Government, they are
     prepared to hand over for trial any Serbian subject, without
     regard to his situation or rank, of whose complicity in the crime
     of Sarajevo proofs are forthcoming, and more especially they
     undertake to cause to be published on the first page of the
     'Journal officiel,' on the date of July 26, the following
     declaration":</p>
</div>

<p>[Here follows the declaration required by Austria-Hungary, with
alterations intended to lessen the humiliation, which changes will be
noted in a following criticism by the Austro-Hungarian Foreign Office.]</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"This declaration will be brought to the knowledge of the Royal
     army in an order of the day, in the name of his majesty the king,
     by his Royal Highness the Crown Prince Alexander, and will be
     published in the next official army bulletin.</p>

     <p>"The Royal Government further undertake:</p>

     <p>"1. To introduce at the first regular convocation of the
     Skupshtina a provision into the press law providing for the most
     severe punishment of incitement to hatred or contempt of the
     Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, and for taking action against any
     publication the general tendency of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page396" name="page396"></a>(p. 396)</span> which is directed
     against the territorial integrity of Austria-Hungary. The
     Government engage at the approaching revision of the Constitution
     to cause an amendment to be introduced into Article XXII of the
     Constitution of such a nature that such publication may be
     confiscated, a proceeding at present impossible under the
     categorical terms of Article XXII of the Constitution.</p>

     <p>"2. The Government possess no proof, nor does the note of the
     Imperial and Royal Government furnish them with any, that the
     'Narodna Odbrana' and other similar societies have committed up
     to the present any criminal act of this nature through the
     proceedings of any of their members. Nevertheless, the Royal
     Government will accept the demand of the Imperial and Royal
     Government, and will dissolve the 'Narodna Odbrana" Society and
     every other society which may be directing its efforts against
     Austria-Hungary.</p>

     <p>"3. The Royal Serbian Government undertake to remove without
     delay from their public educational establishments in Serbia all
     that serves or could serve to foment propaganda against
     Austria-Hungary, whenever the Imperial and Royal Government
     furnish them with facts and proofs of this propaganda.</p>

     <p>"4. The Royal Government also agree to remove from military
     service all such persons as the judicial inquiry may have proved
     to be guilty of acts directed against the integrity of the
     territory of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, and they expect the
     Imperial and Royal Government to communicate to them at a later
     date the names and the acts of these officers and officials for
     the purposes of the proceedings which are to be taken against
     them.</p>

     <p>"5. The Royal Government must confess that they do not clearly
     grasp the meaning or the scope of the demand made by the Imperial
     and Royal Government that Serbia shall undertake to accept the
     collaboration of the organs of the Imperial and Royal Government
     upon their territory, but they declare that they will admit such
     collaboration as agrees with the principle of international law,
     with criminal procedure, and with good neighborly relations.</p>

     <p>"6. It goes without saying that the Royal Government consider it
     their duty to open an inquiry against all such persons as are, or
     eventually may be, implicated in the plot of June 28, and who
     happen to be within the territory of the kingdom. As regards the
     participation in this inquiry of Austro-Hungarian agents or
     authorities appointed for this purpose by the Imperial and Royal
     Government, the Royal Government cannot accept such an
     arrangement, as it would be a violation of the constitution and
     of the law of criminal procedure; nevertheless, in concrete cases
     communications as to the results of the investigations in
     question might be given to the Austro-Hungarian agents.</p>

     <p>"7. The Royal Government proceeded, on the very evening of the
     delivery of the note, to arrest Commandant Voislav Tankossitch.
     As regards Milan Ziganovitch, who is a subject of the
     Austro-Hungarian Monarchy and who up to June 28 was employed (on
     probation) by the directorate of railways, it has not yet been
     possible to arrest him.</p>

     <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page397" name="page397"></a>(p. 397)</span> "The Austro-Hungarian Government are requested to be so
     good as to supply as soon as possible, in the customary form, the
     presumptive evidence of guilt, as well as the eventual proofs of
     guilt which have been collected up to the present, at the inquiry
     at Sarajevo for the purposes of the later inquiry.</p>

     <p>"8. The Serbian Government will reinforce and extend the measures
     which have been taken for preventing the illicit traffic of arms
     and explosives across the frontier. It goes without saying that
     they will immediately order an inquiry and will severely punish
     the frontier officials on the Schabatz-Loznitza line who have
     failed in their duty and allowed the authors of the crime of
     Sarajevo to pass.</p>

     <p>"9. The Royal Government will gladly give explanations of the
     remarks made by their officials whether in Serbia or abroad, in
     interviews after the crime which according to the statement of
     the Imperial and Royal Government were hostile toward the [Dual]
     Monarchy, as soon as the Imperial and Royal Government have
     communicated to them the passages in question in these remarks,
     and as soon as they have shown that the remarks were actually
     made by the said officials, although the Royal Government will
     itself take steps to collect evidence and proofs.</p>

     <p>"10. The Royal Government will inform the Imperial and Royal
     Government of the execution of the measures comprised under the
     above heads, in so far as this has not already been done by the
     present note, as soon as each measure has been ordered and
     carried out.</p>

     <p>"If the Imperial and Royal Government are not satisfied with this
     reply, the Serbian Government, considering that it is not to the
     common interest to precipitate the solution of this question, are
     ready, as always, to accept a pacific understanding, either by
     referring this question to the decision of the International
     Tribunal of The Hague, or to the Great Powers which took part in
     the drawing up of the declaration made by the Serbian Government
     on March 31, 1909."</p>
</div>

<p>The Austro-Hungarian Minister to Belgrade, Baron Giesl von Gieslingen,
to whom the reply was delivered, on comparing it with his instructions,
declared it unsatisfactory, and informed M. Pashitch, the Serbian Prime
Minister that he and his legation would leave Belgrade that evening,
turning over his Government's interests in Serbia to the German
Legation. Rupture in diplomatic relations between Austria-Hungary and
Serbia, he said, was a <i>fait accompli</i>. These events M. Pashitch
reported on the same day to all the Serbian Legations abroad, and
further announced:</p>

     <p class="quote">"The Royal Serbian Government have summoned the Skupshtina to
     meet on July 27 at Nish, whither all the ministries with their
     staffs are proceeding this evening. The crown prince has issued,
     in the name of the king, an order for the mobilization of the
     army, while to-morrow or the day after a <span class="pagenum"><a id="page398" name="page398"></a>(p. 398)</span> proclamation
     will be made in which it will be announced that civilians who are
     not liable to military service should remain peaceably at home,
     while soldiers should proceed to their appointed posts and defend
     the country to the best of their ability, in the event of Serbia
     being attacked."</p>

<p>The Austrian Minister left Belgrade at 6.30 p. m. for Vienna. On the
same day the Serbian Minister at Vienna, M. Yov. Yovanovitch, received
his passports. On the same day the Serbian reply was presented at
Vienna, where it received the following commentaries by the Foreign
Office:</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"The Royal Serbian Government limits itself to establishing that
     since the declaration of March 31, 1909, there has been no
     attempt on the part of the Serbian Government to alter the
     position of Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>

     <p>"With this she deliberately shifts the foundation of our note, as
     we have not insisted that she and her officials have undertaken
     anything official in this direction. Our gravamen is that in
     spite of the obligation assumed in the cited note, she has
     omitted to suppress the movement directed against the territorial
     integrity of the monarchy.</p>

     <p>"Her obligation consisted in changing her attitude and the entire
     direction of her policies, and in entering into friendly and
     neighborly relations with the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, and not
     to interfere with the possession of Bosnia.</p>

     <p>"The assertion of the Royal Serbian Government that the
     expressions of the press and the activity of Serbian associations
     possess a private character and thus escape governmental control,
     stands in full contrast with the institutions of modern states
     and even the most liberal of press and society laws, which nearly
     everywhere subject the press and the societies to a certain
     control of the state. This is also provided for by the Serbian
     institutions. The rebuke against the Serbian Government consists
     in the fact that it has totally omitted to supervise its press
     and its societies, in so far as it knew their direction to be
     hostile to the [Dual] Monarchy.</p>

     <p>"The assertion [that the Serbian Government was ready to proceed
     against all persons in regard to whom it would receive
     information] is incorrect. The Serbian Government was accurately
     informed about the suspicion resting upon quite definite
     personalities and not only in the position, but also obliged by
     its own laws to institute investigations spontaneously. The
     Serbian Government has done nothing in this direction."</p>
</div>

<p>The Austro-Hungarian Foreign Office objected to the alterations made by
Serbia in the declaration published in the official organ. This, in the
Serbian reply, began:</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"The Royal Serbian Government condemns every propaganda which
     should be directed against Austria-Hungary.</p>

     <p>"The Austrian demand reads: 'The Royal Serbian Government
     condemns the propaganda against Austria-Hungary....' The
     alteration of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page399" name="page399"></a>(p. 399)</span> declaration as demanded by us, which
     has been made by the Royal Serbian Government, is meant to imply
     that a propaganda directed against Austria-Hungary does not
     exist, and that it is not aware of such. This formula is
     insincere, and the Serbian Government reserves itself the
     subterfuge for later occasions that it had not disavowed by this
     declaration the existing propaganda, nor recognized the same as
     hostile to the [Dual] Monarchy, whence it could deduce further
     that it is not obliged to suppress in the future a propaganda
     similar to the present one."</p>
</div>

<p>Objection was similarly made to the alteration in the Serbian apology
for acts of Serbian officers. This apology began:</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"The Royal Government regrets that according to a communication
     of the Imperial and Royal Government certain Serbian officers and
     functionaries have participated in the propaganda.</p>

     <p>"The formula as demanded by Austria reads: The Royal Government
     regrets that Serbian officers and functionaries ... have
     participated.... Also with this formula and the further addition
     'according to the declaration of the Imperial and Royal
     Government,' the Serbian Government pursues the object, already
     indicated above, to preserve a free hand for the future.</p>

     <p>"Austria had demanded:</p>

     <p>"1. To suppress every publication which incites to hatred and
     contempt for the [Dual] Monarchy, and whose tendency is directed
     against the territorial integrity of the monarchy.</p>

     <p>"We wanted to bring about the obligation for Serbia to take care
     that such attacks of the press would cease in the future.</p>

     <p>"Instead Serbia offers to pass certain laws which are meant as
     means toward this end, viz:</p>

     <p>"(<i>a</i>) A law according to which the expressions of the press
     hostile to the [Dual] Monarchy can be individually punished, a
     matter which is immaterial to us, all the more so, as the
     individual prosecution of press intrigues is very rarely possible
     and as, with a lax enforcement of such laws, the few cases of
     this nature would not be punished. The proposition, therefore,
     does not meet our demand in any way, and it offers not the least
     guaranty for the desired success.</p>

     <p>"(<i>b</i>) An amendment to article 22 of the constitution, which
     would permit confiscation, a proposal which does not satisfy us,
     as the existence of such a law in Serbia is of no use to us. For
     we want the <i>obligation</i> of the Government to <i>enforce</i> it and
     that has not been promised us.</p>

     <p>"These proposals are therefore entirely unsatisfactory and
     evasive as we are not told within what time these laws will be
     passed, and as in the event of the not passing of these laws by
     the Skupshtina everything would remain as it is, except in the
     event of a possible resignation of the Government.</p>

     <p>"2. The propaganda of the Narodna Odbrana and affiliated
     societies hostile to the [Dual] Monarchy fills the entire public
     life of Serbia; it is therefore an entirely inacceptable reserve
     if the Serbian Government asserts that it knows nothing about it.
     Aside from this, our demand is not completely fulfilled, as we
     have asked besides:</p>

     <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page400" name="page400"></a>(p. 400)</span> "To confiscate the means of propaganda of these
     societies to prevent the reformation of the dissolved societies
     under another name and in another form.</p>

     <p>"In these two directions the Belgrade Cabinet is perfectly
     silent, so that through this semiconcession there is offered us
     no guaranty for putting an end to the agitation of the
     associations hostile to the monarchy, especially the Narodna
     Odbrana.</p>

     <p>"3. The Serbian Government first demands proofs for a propaganda
     hostile to the monarchy in the public instruction of Serbia while
     it must know that the textbooks introduced in the Serbian schools
     contain objectionable matter in this direction and that a large
     portion of the teachers are in the camp of the Narodna Odbrana
     and affiliated societies.</p>

     <p>"Furthermore the Serbian Government has not fulfilled a part of
     our demands, as we have requested, as it omitted in its text the
     addition desired by us: 'as far as the body of instructors is
     concerned, as well as the means of instruction'&mdash;a sentence which
     shows clearly where the propaganda hostile to the monarchy is to
     be found in the Serbian schools.</p>

     <p>"4. By promising the dismissal from the military and civil
     services of those officers and officials who are found guilty by
     judicial procedure, the Serbian Government limits its assent to
     those cases, in which these persons have been charged with a
     crime according to the statutory code. As, however, we demand the
     removal of such officers and officials as indulge in a propaganda
     hostile to the monarchy, which is generally not punishable in
     Serbia, our demands have not been fulfilled in this point."</p>
</div>

5. The Serbian reply declared that Serbia was willing to permit that
cooperation of officials of the [Dual] Monarchy on Serbian territory
which does not run counter to international law and criminal law.

<div class="quote">
     <p>"The international law, as well as the criminal law, has nothing
     to do with this question; it is purely a matter of the nature of
     state police which is to be solved by way of a special agreement.
     The reserved attitude of Serbia is therefore incomprehensible and
     on account of its vague general form it would lead to
     unbridgeable difficulties.</p>

     <p>"6. The Austrian demand was clear and unmistakable:</p>

     <p>"1. To institute a criminal procedure against the participants in
     the outrage.</p>

     <p>"2. Participation by Imperial and Royal Government officials in
     the examinations ('recherche' in contrast with 'enquête
     judiciaire').</p>

     <p>"3. It did not occur to us to let Imperial and Royal Government
     officials participate in the Serbian court procedure; they were
     to cooperate only in the police researches which had to furnish
     and fix the material for the investigation.</p>

     <p>"If the Serbian Government misunderstands us here, this is done
     deliberately, for it must be familiar with the difference between
     'enquête judiciaire' and simple police researches. As it desired
     to escape from every control of the investigation which would
     yield, if correctly carried out, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page401" name="page401"></a>(p. 401)</span> highly undesirable
     results for it, and as it possesses no means to refuse in a
     plausible manner the cooperation of our officials (precedents for
     such police intervention exist in great numbers) it tries to
     justify its refusal by showing up our demands as impossible.</p>

     <p>"(In reference to arrest of conspirators).</p>

     <p>"7. This reply is disingenuous. According to our investigation,
     Ciganowic, by order of the police prefect in Belgrade, left three
     days after the outrage for Ribari, after it had become known that
     Ciganowic had participated in the outrage. In the first place, it
     is therefore incorrect that Ciganowic left the Serbian service on
     June 28. In the second place, we add that the prefect of police
     at Belgrade, who had himself caused the departure of this
     Ciganowic and who knew his whereabout, declared in an interview
     that a man by the name of Milan Ciganowic did not exist in
     Belgrade.</p>

     <p>"9. (In reference to expressions made against Austria-Hungary by
     Serbian officials in interviews.)</p>

     <p>"The Royal Serbian Government must be aware of the interviews in
     question. If it demands of the Imperial and Royal Government that
     it should furnish all kinds of detail about the said interviews
     and if it reserves for itself the right of a formal
     investigation, it shows that it is not its intention seriously to
     fulfill the demand.</p>

     <p>"10. (In reference to referring the dispute to arbitration of the
     powers.)</p>

     <p>"The Serbian Note, therefore, is entirely a play for time."</p>
</div>


<h4>BEGINNING OF MOBILIZATION</h4>

<p>The diplomatic issue now became that over mobilization by Russia:
whether it was a threat of war against Austria-Hungary alone, or against
Germany as well.</p>

<p>On the day of Serbia's reply to the Austro-Hungarian note, July 25,
1914, General von Chelius, German honorary aide to the Czar, sent a
telegram to Kaiser William II through the German Foreign Office, which
stated:</p>

     <p class="quote">"The maneuvers of the troops in the Krasnoe camp were suddenly
     interrupted and the regiments returned to their garrisons at
     once. The maneuvers have been cancelled. The military pupils were
     raised to-day to the rank of officers instead of next fall. At
     headquarters there obtains great excitement over the procedure of
     Austria. I have the impression that complete preparations for
     mobilization against Austria are being made."</p>

<p>On the same day Count Benckendorff, Russian Ambassador at London,
telegraphed M. Sazonof, Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs:</p>

     <p class="quote">"Grey has told the German Ambassador [Prince Lichnowsky] that in
     his opinion Austrian mobilization must lead to Russian
     mobilization, that grave danger of a general war will thereupon
     arise, and that he sees only <span class="pagenum"><a id="page402" name="page402"></a>(p. 402)</span> one means of reaching a
     peaceful settlement, namely, that, in view of the Austrian and
     Russian mobilizations, Germany, France, Italy, and Great Britain
     should abstain from immediate mobilization, and should at once
     offer their good offices. Grey told me that the first essential
     of this plan was the consent of Germany and her promise not to
     mobilize. He has therefore, as a first step, made an inquiry on
     this point at Berlin."</p>

<p>On the same day the German Chancellor, Dr. Bethmann-Hollweg, telegraphed
to Prince Lichnowsky:</p>

     <p class="quote">"The distinction made by Sir Edward Grey between an
     Austro-Serbian and an Austro-Russian conflict is perfectly
     correct. We do not wish to interpose in the former any more than
     England, and as heretofore we take the position that this
     question must be localized by virtue of all powers refraining
     from intervention. It is therefore our hope that Russia will
     refrain from any action in view of her responsibility and the
     seriousness of the situation. We are prepared, in the event of an
     Austro-Russian controversy, quite apart from our known duties as
     Allies, to intercede between Russia and Austria jointly with the
     other powers."</p>


<h3>SUNDAY, JULY 26, 1914</h3>

<p><i>Austria-Hungary.</i> The Austro-Hungarian Ambassador at St. Petersburg,
Count Szápáry, telegraphed to Count Berchtold, Secretary for Foreign
Affairs in Vienna, that Count Pourtalès the German Ambassador, upon
hearing reports of measures for Russian mobilization, had called the
attention of M. Sazonof, the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, to
the fact that nowadays mobilization was a highly dangerous form of
diplomatic pressure.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"For, in that event, the purely military consideration of the
     question by the general staffs would find expression, and if that
     button were once touched in Germany, the situation would get out
     of control.</p>

     <p>"M. Sazonof assured the German Ambassador on his word of honor
     that the reports on the subject were incorrect; that up to that
     time not a single horse and not a single reservist had been
     called up, and that all the measures that were being taken were
     merely measures of preparation in the military districts of Kiev,
     Odessa, and perhaps Kazan and Moscow."</p>
</div>

<p>M. Suchomlinoff, Russian Minister for War, had immediately after this,
summoned Major von Eggeling, German Military Attaché and confirmed M.
Sazonof's assurance in detail. As reported by the major, he said:</p>

     <p class="quote">"For the present merely preparatory measures would be taken, not
     a horse would be taken, not a reservist called up. If Austria
     crossed the Serbian frontier, the military districts of Kiev,
     Odessa, Moscow, and Kazan, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page403" name="page403"></a>(p. 403)</span> which face Austria, would be
     mobilized. In no circumstances will mobilization take place on
     the German front, Warsaw, Vilna, and St. Petersburg. Peace with
     Germany is earnestly desired.... I gave the Minister for War to
     understand that his friendly intentions would be appreciated by
     us, but that we should also consider mobilization against Austria
     to be in itself extremely threatening."</p>

<p><i>Russia.</i> M. Sazonof, Minister for Foreign Affairs, telegraphed the
Ambassador at Rome to persuade the Italian Government to act in the
interests of peace by bringing influence to bear on her ally,
Austria-Hungary, and by opposing the view that the dispute with Serbia
could be localized. Russia cannot possibly avoid coming to the help of
Serbia. M. Kasansky, Acting Consul at Prague, telegraphed that
Austro-Hungarian mobilization had been ordered. M. Sazonof reported to
M. Schebeko, Ambassador at Vienna, an interview just held with Count
Szápáry, the Austro-Hungarian Ambassador.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"After discussing the ten demands addressed to Serbia, I drew his
     attention to the fact that, quite apart from the clumsy form in
     which they were presented, some of them were quite impracticable,
     even if the Serbian Government agreed to accept them. Thus, for
     example, points one and two could not be carried out without
     recasting the Serbian press law and associations law, and to that
     it might be difficult to obtain the consent of the Skupshtina. As
     for enforcing points four and five, this might lead to most
     dangerous consequences, and even to the risk of acts of terrorism
     directed against the Royal Family and against Pashitch, which
     clearly could not be the intention of Austria. With regard to the
     other points it seemed to me that, with certain changes of
     detail, it would not be difficult to find a basis of mutual
     agreement, if the accusations contained in them were confirmed by
     sufficient proof.</p>

     <p>"In the interest of the maintenance of peace, which, according to
     the statements of Szápáry, is as much desired by Austria as by
     all the powers, it was necessary to end the tension of the
     present moment as soon as possible. With this object in view it
     seemed to me most desirable that the Austro-Hungarian Ambassador
     should be authorized to enter into a private exchange of views in
     order to redraft certain articles of the Austrian note of July 23
     in consultation with me. This method of procedure would perhaps
     enable us to find a formula which would prove acceptable to
     Serbia, while giving satisfaction to Austria in respect of the
     chief of her demands. Please convey the substance of this
     telegram to the Minister for Foreign Affairs in a judicious and
     friendly manner."</p>
</div>

<p>Communicated to Russian Ambassadors in Germany, France, Great Britain,
and Italy. The Ambassador at Berlin was requested to communicate the
contents of the telegram to Secretary <span class="pagenum"><a id="page404" name="page404"></a>(p. 404)</span> of State von Jagow, and
express to him the hope that he would advise Vienna to meet Russia's
proposal in a friendly spirit.</p>

<p>M. Sevastopoulo, Chargé d'Affaires at Paris, telegraphed M. Sazonof
that, when M. Berthelot, French Political Director, informed Count
Szécen, Austro-Hungarian Ambassador, of the Serbian reply to the
ultimatum, the count did not conceal his surprise that it was not
accepted.</p>

<p>In a supplementary telegram he said M. Berthelot was convinced that
Germany's aim, in her negotiations at Paris, was to intimidate France to
mediate with Russia.</p>

<p>M. Broniewsky, Chargé d'Affaires at Berlin, reported noisy
demonstrations there by a crowd largely composed of Austrians on news of
Austrian mobilization, and anti-Russian shouting by the crowd before the
Russian Embassy. No precautions were taken by the police.</p>

<p><i>Germany.</i> Major von Eggeling telegraphed to the German Chancellor, Dr.
von Bethmann-Hollweg, that it was certain mobilization had been ordered
for Kiev and Odessa; it was doubtful at Warsaw and Moscow, and
improbable elsewhere in Russia.</p>

<p>The Chancellor telegraphed to Baron von Schoen, German Ambassador at
Paris, after Austria-Hungary's official declaration to Russia, that she
had no intention to annex the territory of Serbia or to impair her
sovereignty, the responsibility for a European war rested on Russia.</p>

     <p class="quote">"We depend upon France, with which we are at one in the desire
     for the preservation of the peace of Europe, that it will
     exercise its influence at St. Petersburg in favor of peace."</p>

<p>This telegram, without the final sentence, the Chancellor sent also to
Count Pourtalès, German Ambassador at St. Petersburg, and to Prince
Lichnowsky, German Ambassador at London, adding in the latter case that
a call was expected for the several classes of Russian reserves, which
would be equivalent to mobilization, and, in this case, Germany would be
forced to mobilize, much against her wish.</p>

     <p class="quote">"We ask [Great Britain] to act on this understanding at St.
     Petersburg with all possible emphasis."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page405" name="page405"></a>(p. 405)</span> Count Pourtalès was directed to make the following declaration
to the Russian Government:</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"Preparatory military measures by Russia will force us to
     countermeasures which must consist in mobilizing the army.</p>

     <p>"But mobilization means war.</p>

     <p>"As we know the obligations of France toward Russia, this
     mobilization would be directed against both Russia and France. We
     cannot assume that Russia desires to unchain such a European war.
     Since Austria-Hungary will not touch the existence of the Serbian
     Kingdom, we are of the opinion that Russia can afford to assume
     an attitude of waiting. We can all the more support the desire of
     Russia to protect the integrity of Serbia as Austria-Hungary does
     not intend to question the latter. It will be easy in the further
     development of the affair to find a basis for an understanding."</p>
</div>

<p><i>Great Britain.</i> Sir Maurice de Bunsen, British Ambassador at Vienna,
telegraphed to Sir Edward Grey, Secretary for Foreign Affairs at London,
that it was the belief of the German Ambassador, Herr von Tschirscky,
that Russia would keep quiet during the chastisement of Serbia.
Everything, said Von Tschirscky, depended on the personality of the
Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, who could resist easily the
pressure of a few newspapers; pan-Slav agitation in Russia was over;
intervention in behalf of Serbia would open up Swedish, Polish,
Ruthenian, Rumanian, and Persian questions; France, too, was not in a
condition for war. Von Tschirscky doubted that Russia, who had no right
to assume a protectorate over Serbia, would assert it by action; Germany
knew what she was about in backing up Austria-Hungary; the Serbian
concessions were all a sham, as proved by the Government previously
ordering mobilization and preparing to retire from Belgrade.</p>

<p>Sir Horace Rumbold, British Chargé d'Affaires in Berlin, telegraphed Sir
Edward Grey that Kaiser William was returning suddenly that night (from
a sea trip to Norway) on his own initiative, and that the Foreign Office
regretted it, owing to the speculation and excitement which it would
cause. Herr von Zimmermann, German Under-Secretary of State, had
inferred from Russia's statement that she would intervene in case of
annexation of Serbian territory; that she would not do so if no
territory were taken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page406" name="page406"></a>(p. 406)</span> In a supplementary telegram Sir Horace informed Sir Edward that
Von Zimmermann considered that the communication by Germany to
Austria-Hungary of his (Grey's) hope for a favorable view of the Serbian
reply implied that the German Government associated itself to a certain
extent with Grey's hope. It did not, however, go beyond this.</p>

<p>Sir Rennell Rodd, British Ambassador at Rome, telegraphed Sir Edward
Grey that Austria-Hungary had informed the Italian Government that the
Austro-Hungarian Minister to Belgrade had been recalled, but that this
did not imply a declaration of war.</p>

<p>Sir Edward telegraphed to Sir Rennell Rodd, Sir Francis Bertie,
Ambassador at Paris, and Sir Horace Rumbold, Chargé d'Affaires at
Berlin, to ask if the ministers of foreign affairs at their courts would
instruct their ambassadors at London to meet with him in conference "to
discover an issue which would prevent complications," and to suggest
that the ministers should instruct their representatives at Belgrade,
Vienna, and St. Petersburg to request a suspension of military
operations pending results of the conference.</p>

<p>Sir Maurice de Bunsen, British Ambassador at Vienna, telegraphed to Sir
Edward Grey that the Russian Ambassador, M. Schebeko, just returned from
leave of absence, thinks Austria-Hungary determined on war, and that it
will be impossible for Russia to remain indifferent. He and the French
Ambassador, M. Dumaine, doubt whether the principle of Grey's suggestion
that Russia, being an interested party, is entitled to have a say in a
purely Austro-Serbian dispute, would be accepted by either
Austria-Hungary or Germany.</p>

<p><i>France.</i> M. Bienvenu-Martin, Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs,
notified M. Viviani, Prime Minister on board <i>La France</i>, and the French
Ambassadors at London, St. Petersburg, Berlin, Vienna, and Rome, of the
events at Belgrade on Saturday, July 25, ending with the order for
mobilization given by the Serbian Government, which had retired to
Kragoujewatz, whither it was followed by the French and Russian
Ministers. At Vienna people "soothe themselves with the illusion that
Russia 'will not hold firm.'"</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page407" name="page407"></a>(p. 407)</span> "It must not be forgotten that Italy is bound by the
     engagements of the Triple Alliance only if she has been consulted
     beforehand.</p>

     <p>"From St. Petersburg we learn that M. Sazonof [Minister for
     Foreign Affairs] has advised Serbia to ask for British mediation.
     At the Council of Ministers on the 25th, which was held in
     presence of the emperor, the mobilization of thirteen army corps
     intended eventually to operate against Austria was considered;
     this mobilization, however, would only be made effective if
     Austria were to bring armed pressure to bear upon Serbia, and not
     till after notice had been given by the Minister for Foreign
     Affairs, upon whom falls the duty of fixing the day, liberty
     being left to him to go on with negotiations even if Belgrade
     should be occupied. Russian opinion makes clear that it is both
     politically and morally impossible for Russia to allow Serbia to
     be crushed.</p>

     <p>"In London the German <i>démarche</i> was made on the 25th, in the
     same terms as those used by Baron von Schoen at Paris. Sir Edward
     Grey has replied to Prince Lichnowsky that if the war were to
     break out no power in Europe could take up a detached attitude.
     He did not express himself more definitely and used very reserved
     language to the Serbian Minister [M. Boschkovitch]. The
     communication made on the evening of the 25th by the Austrian
     Ambassador makes Sir Edward Grey more optimistic; since the
     diplomatic rupture does not necessarily involve immediate
     military operations, the Secretary of State is still willing to
     hope that the powers will have time to intervene.</p>

     <p>"At Berlin the language used by the Secretary of State [Von
     Jagow] to the Russian Chargé d'Affaires [Broniewsky] is
     unsatisfactory and dilatory; when the latter asked him to
     associate himself with a <i>démarche</i> at Vienna for an extension of
     the time limit, he replied that he had already taken action in
     this sense but that it was too late; to the request for an
     extension of the time limit before active measures were taken, he
     replied that this had to do with a domestic matter, and not with
     a war but with local operations. Herr von Jagow pretends not to
     believe that the Austrian action could lead to general
     consequences.</p>

     <p>"A real explosion of chauvinism has taken place at Berlin. The
     German Emperor returns direct to Kiel. M. Jules Cambon thinks
     that, at the first military steps taken by Russia, Germany would
     immediately reply, and probably would not wait for a pretext
     before attacking us.</p>

     <p>"At Vienna, the French Ambassador [Dumaine] has not had time to
     join in the <i>démarche</i> of his Russian colleague [Schebeko] for
     obtaining an extension of the time limit fixed for Serbia; he
     does not regret it, this <i>démarche</i> having been categorically
     rejected, and England not having had time to give instructions to
     her representative about it.</p>

     <p>"A note from the British Embassy has been delivered to me: it
     gives an account of the conversation between the British
     Ambassador at St. Petersburg [Buchanan] and M. Sazonof and M.
     Paléologue. Sir Edward Grey thinks that the four powers who are
     not directly interested ought to press both on Russia and Austria
     that their armies should not cross the frontier, and that they
     should give time to England, France, Germany, and Italy to bring
     their mediation into play. If Germany accepts, the British
     <span class="pagenum"><a id="page408" name="page408"></a>(p. 408)</span> Government has reason to think that Italy also would be
     glad to be associated in the joint action of England and France;
     the adherence of Germany is essential, for neither Austria nor
     Russia would tolerate any intervention except that of impartial
     friends or Allies."</p>
</div>

<p>M. Barrère, French Ambassador at Rome, informed M. Bienvenu-Martin that
a telegram from Vienna stated that diplomatic rupture between Austria
and Serbia had taken place, and Austria was proceeding to military
measures. Marquis di San Giuliano, the Prime Minister, would return in
two days to Rome. The president of the council had given Barrère the
impression that Italy would be neutral in case of war, maintaining "an
attitude of observation." M. Salandra [afterward Prime Minister] had
said that:</p>

     <p class="quote">"'We shall make the greatest efforts to prevent peace being
     broken; our situation is somewhat analogous to that of England.
     Perhaps we could do something in a pacific sense together with
     the English.' M. Salandra stated definitely to me that the
     Austrian note had been communicated to Rome at the last moment."</p>

<p>M. Barrère, in a second telegram, said that the greater part of Italian
public opinion was hostile to Austria "in this serious business."</p>

<p>M. Paléologue, French Ambassador at St. Petersburg, telegraphed that M.
Sazonof, Minister for Foreign Affairs, had advised Serbia to ask for
British mediation. M. Bienvenu-Martin thereupon telegraphed M. de
Fleuriau, Chargé d'Affaires, London, that France desired British
mediation. M. Paléologue reported at greater length M. Sazonof's
determination to secure a peaceful solution to the Serbian question.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"'Up to the last moment,' he declared to me, 'I shall show myself
     ready to negotiate.'</p>

     <p>"It is in this spirit that he has just sent for Count Szápáry to
     come to a 'frank and loyal explanation.' M. Sazonof commented in
     his presence on the Austro-Hungarian ultimatum, article by
     article, making clear the insulting character of the principal
     clauses. 'The intention which inspired this document,' he said,
     'is legitimate if you pursued no aim other than the protection of
     your territory against the intrigues of Serbian anarchists; but
     the procedure to which you have had recourse is not defensible.'
     He concluded: 'Take back your ultimatum, modify its form, and I
     will guarantee you the result.'</p>

     <p>"The Austro-Hungarian Ambassador showed himself moved by this
     language; however, while awaiting instructions, he reserves the
     opinion <span class="pagenum"><a id="page409" name="page409"></a>(p. 409)</span> of his Government. Without being discouraged M.
     Sazonof has decided to propose this evening to Count Berchtold
     the opening of direct conversations between Vienna and St.
     Petersburg on the changes to be introduced into the ultimatum.</p>

     <p>"This friendly and semiofficial interposition of Russia between
     Austria and Serbia has the advantage of being expeditious. I
     therefore believe it to be preferable to any other procedure and
     likely to succeed."</p>
</div>

<p>M. Dumaine, French Ambassador at Vienna, reported to M. Bienvenu-Martin
that M. Schebeko, Russian Ambassador, had returned in haste from Russia,
whither he had gone on the assurance of Count Berchtold,
Austro-Hungarian Minister for Foreign Affairs, that the demands on
Serbia would be acceptable. Other Austrian officials had taken the same
attitude, which is quite usual in Austro-Hungarian diplomacy, and this
procedure has greatly increased the irritation of the Russian
Government.</p>

<p>M. Schebeko, seizing advantage of the delay of mobilization, will make a
proposal calculated to test the value of the pacific declarations of
Germany. This is for a conference of the British, French, Italian, and
German Ambassadors, to refuse concurrence in which the German
Ambassador, M. Tschirsky, will almost certainly have to plead the
principle of "localizing the conflict."</p>

     <p class="quote">"My impression is that the Austro-Hungarian Government, although
     surprised and perhaps regretting the vigor with which they have
     been inspired, will believe themselves obliged to commence
     military action."</p>

<p>M. Bienvenu-Martin reported to M. Viviani on <i>La France</i> and to the
ambassadors at London, St. Petersburg, Berlin, Vienna, and Rome the
rupture of diplomatic relations with Serbia made by Austria-Hungary.</p>

     <p class="quote">"According to a telegram from M. Jules Cambon [at Berlin], the
     British Ambassador [Sir Edward Goschen] thinks that there is a
     slight yielding; when he observed to Herr von Jagow that Sir
     Edward Grey did not ask him to intervene between Austria and
     Serbia, but, as this question ceased to be localized, to
     intervene with England, France, and Italy at Vienna and St.
     Petersburg, the Secretary of State declared that he would do his
     best to maintain peace."</p>

<p>M. Bienvenu-Martin also reported that Italy, not having been consulted
about the note to Serbia, felt herself relieved from all responsibility
in the grave step taken by her ally. He also told of his answer to the
German Ambassador, Baron von Schoen, who sought France's influence to
keep Russia from war, that Germany <span class="pagenum"><a id="page410" name="page410"></a>(p. 410)</span> ought, on her side, to
influence Austria-Hungary to avoid military operations leading to the
occupation of Serbia, and the consequent intervention of Russia.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"The ambassador having observed to me that this could not be
     reconciled with the position taken up by Germany 'that the
     question concerned only Austria and Serbia,' I told him that
     mediation at Vienna and St. Petersburg would be the act of the
     four other powers less interested in the question.</p>

     <p>"Herr von Schoen then intrenched himself behind his lack of
     instructions in this respect, and I told him that in these
     conditions I did not feel myself in a position to take any action
     at St. Petersburg alone."</p>
</div>

<p>After his visit to M. Bienvenu-Martin at 5 p. m. Baron von Schoen went
to see M. Berthelot, the Political Director, to have an account of the
interview officially published in the press. The article he proposed
indicated the most amicable cooperation between France and Germany in
the furtherance of European peace.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"The Political Director replied at once, 'Then, in your opinion,
     every thing is settled, and you bring us the assurance that
     Austria accepts the Serbian note or will enter into conversations
     with the powers on this matter?' The ambassador having ...
     vigorously denied the suggestion, it was explained to him that if
     there was no modification in Germany's negative attitude, the
     terms of the suggested 'note to the press' were exaggerated, and
     of a nature to give a false security to French opinion by
     creating illusion on the real situation, the dangers of which
     were only too evident.</p>

     <p>"To the assurances lavished by the German Ambassador as to the
     optimistic impressions which he had formed, the Acting Political
     Director replied by asking if he might speak to him in a manner
     quite personal and private, as man to man, quite freely and
     without regard to their respective functions. Baron von Schoen
     asked him to do so.</p>

     <p>"M. Berthelot then said that to any simple mind Germany's
     attitude was inexplicable if it did not aim at war; a purely
     objective analysis of the facts and the psychology of the
     Austro-German relations led logically to this conclusion. In the
     face of the repeated statement that Germany was ignorant of the
     contents of the Austrian note, it was no longer permissible to
     raise any doubt on that point; but was it probable that Germany
     would have arrayed herself on the side of Austria in such an
     adventure with her eyes closed? Did the psychology of all the
     past relations of Vienna and Berlin allow one to admit that
     Austria could have taken up a position without any possible
     retreat, before having weighed with her ally all the consequences
     of her uncompromising attitude? How surprising appeared the
     refusal by Germany to exercise mediating influence at Vienna now
     that she knew the extraordinary text of the Austrian note! What
     responsibility was the German Government assuming and what
     suspicions would rest upon them if they persisted in interposing
     between Austria and the powers, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page411" name="page411"></a>(p. 411)</span> after what might be
     called the absolute submission of Serbia, and when the slightest
     advice given by them to Vienna would put an end to the nightmare
     which weighed on Europe!</p>

     <p>"The breaking off of diplomatic relations by Austria, her threats
     of war, and the mobilization which she was undertaking make
     peculiarly urgent pacific action on the part of Germany, for from
     the day when Austrian troops crossed the Serbian frontier, one
     would be faced by an act which without doubt would oblige the St.
     Petersburg Cabinet to intervene, and would risk the unloosing of
     a war which Germany declares that she wishes to avoid.</p>

     <p>"Herr von Schoen, who listened smiling, once more affirmed that
     Germany had been ignorant of the text of the Austrian note, and
     had approved it only after its delivery; she thought, however,
     that Serbia had need of a lesson severe enough for her not to be
     able to forget it, and that Austria owed it to herself to put an
     end to a situation which was dangerous and intolerable for a
     great power. He declared besides that he did not know the text of
     the Serbian reply, and showed his personal surprise that it had
     not satisfied Austria, if indeed it was such as the papers, which
     are often ill informed, represented it to be.</p>

     <p>"He insisted again on Germany's peaceful intentions and gave his
     impressions as to the effect that might arise from good advice
     given, for instance, at Vienna, by England in a friendly tone.
     According to him Austria was not uncompromising; what she rejects
     is the idea of a formal mediation, the 'spectre' of a conference:
     a peaceful word coming from St. Petersburg, good words said in a
     conciliatory tone by the powers of the Triple Entente, would have
     a chance of being well received. He added, finally, that he did
     not say that Germany on her side would not give some advice at
     Vienna.</p>

     <p>"In these conditions the Political Director announced that he
     would ask the minister if it appeared to him opportune to
     communicate to the press a short note in a moderate tone."</p>
</div>

<p>M. Chevalley, French Minister at Christiania, telegraphed to M.
Bienvenu-Martin that the whole German fleet in Norway was returning to
Germany. M. d'Annoville, French Chargé d'Affaires at Luxemburg,
telegraphed that the last four classes of [German] reservists set at
liberty had been forbidden to leave their places of residence, and were
ordered to hold themselves at the disposition of the <i>Kommandutur</i> at
any moment.</p>


<h3>MONDAY, JULY 27, 1914</h3>

<p><i>Austria-Hungary.</i> On the following day Count Szápáry, Austro-Hungarian
Ambassador at St. Petersburg, telegraphed Count Berchtold, Minister for
Foreign Affairs at Vienna, of a conversation he had just had with M.
Sazonof.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page412" name="page412"></a>(p. 412)</span> Mistaken impressions, he told the Russian Minister for Foreign
Affairs, were abroad in Russia as to Austria-Hungary's intentions.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"We were credited with wishing to push forward into Balkan
     territory, and to begin a march to Salonica or even to
     Constantinople. Others, again, went so far as to describe our
     action merely as the starting point of a preventive war against
     Russia. I said that all this was erroneous, and that parts of it
     were absolutely unreasonable. The goal of our action was
     self-preservation and self-defense against hostile propaganda by
     word, in writing, and in action, which threatened our integrity.
     It would occur to no one in Austria-Hungary to threaten Russian
     interests, or indeed to pick a quarrel with Russia. And yet we
     were absolutely determined to reach the goal which we had set
     before us, and the path which we had chosen seemed to us the most
     suitable. As, however, the action under discussion was action in
     self-defense, I could not conceal from him that we could not
     allow ourselves to be diverted from it by any consequences, of
     whatever kind they might be.</p>

     <p>"M. Sazonof agreed with me. Our goal, as I had described it to
     him, was an entirely legitimate one, but he considered that the
     path which we were pursuing with a view to attaining it was not
     the surest. He said that the note which we had delivered was not
     happy in its form. He had since been studying it, and if I had
     time, he would like to look it through once more with me. I
     remarked that I was at his service, but was not authorized either
     to discuss the text of the note with him or to interpret it. Of
     course, however, his remarks were of interest. The minister then
     took all the points of the note in order, and on this occasion
     found seven of the ten points admissible without very great
     difficulty; only the two points dealing with the collaboration of
     the Imperial and Royal officials in Serbia and the point dealing
     with the removal of officers and civil servants to be designated
     by us, seemed to him to be unacceptable in their present form.
     With regard, to the first two points, I was in a position to give
     an authentic interpretation in the sense of your excellency's
     telegram of the 25th instant; with regard to the third, I
     expressed the opinion that it was a necessary demand. Moreover,
     matters had already been set in motion. The Serbians had
     mobilized on the previous day, and I did not know what had
     happened since then."</p>
</div>

<p>Count Berchtold instructed Count Szápáry by telegraph to declare to M.
Sazonof that, so long as the war between Austria-Hungary and Serbia
remained localized, the [Dual] Monarchy did not aim in any way at
territorial acquisitions of any sort.</p>

<p>Count Szögyény, Ambassador at Berlin, telegraphed to Count Berchtold
that M. Sazonof had explained to Count Pourtalès, the German Ambassador
at St. Petersburg, that he could not guarantee that Russia had not begun
mobilization, and confessed that certain necessary military measures
were being taken.</p>

     <p class="quote"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page413" name="page413"></a>(p. 413)</span> "Major von Eggeling, German Military Attaché at St.
     Petersburg, reports that the Russian Minister for War, M.
     Suchomlinof, has given him his word of honor that not a man or a
     horse has been mobilized; however, naturally, certain military
     precautions have been taken; precautions which, as the German
     military attaché adds ... 'are to be sure pretty far-reaching.'"</p>

<p>Count Berchtold informed the Austro-Hungarian Ambassadors at Berlin,
Rome, London, Paris, and St. Petersburg of the annotations of his
Government to the Serbian reply.</p>

<p><i>Germany.</i> The Austro-Hungarian Consulate at Kovno, Russia, telegraphed
to the German Chancellor, Dr. von Bethmann-Hollweg, that Kovno had been
declared to be in a state of war.</p>

<p>The German Minister at Berne, Switzerland, telegraphed to the Chancellor
that the French Fourteenth Corps had discontinued maneuvers.</p>

<p>Count Pourtalès, German Ambassador at St. Petersburg, telegraphed to the
Chancellor at Berlin:</p>

     <p class="quote">"The Secretary of War [Suchomlinof] has given me his word of
     honor that no order to mobilize has as yet been issued. Though
     general preparations are being made, no reserves were called and
     no horses mustered. If Austria crossed the Serbian frontier, such
     military districts as are directed toward Austria, viz Kiev,
     Odessa, Moscow, Kazan, are to be mobilized. Under no
     circumstances those on the German frontier, Warsaw, Vilni, St.
     Petersburg. Peace with Germany was desired very much. Upon my
     inquiry into the object of mobilization against Austria he
     shrugged his shoulders and referred to the diplomats. I told the
     secretary that we appreciated the friendly intentions, but
     considered mobilization even against Austria as very menacing."</p>

<p>The Chancellor telegraphed Prince Lichnowsky, German Ambassador at
London:</p>

     <p class="quote">"We know as yet nothing of a suggestion of Sir Edward Grey's to
     hold a quadruple conference in London. It is impossible for us to
     place our ally in his dispute with Serbia before a European
     tribunal. Our mediation must be limited to the danger of an
     Austro-Russian conflict."</p>

<p>This was supplemented by a telegram:</p>

     <p class="quote">"We have at once started the mediation proposal in Vienna in the
     sense as desired by Sir Edward Grey. We have communicated besides
     to Count Berchtold the desire of M. Sazonof for a direct parley
     with Vienna."</p>

<p><i>Russia.</i> Count Benckendorff, Russian Ambassador at London, telegraphed
to M. Sazonof, Minister for Foreign Affairs at St. Petersburg, to know
if his views on direct discussions with the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page414" name="page414"></a>(p. 414)</span> Vienna Cabinet
harmonized with Grey's scheme for mediation by the four powers, Great
Britain, France, Italy, and Germany.</p>

     <p class="quote">"Having heard from the British Ambassador at St. Petersburg that
     you would be prepared to accept such a combination, Grey decided
     to turn it into an official proposal, which he communicated
     yesterday to Berlin, Paris, and Rome."</p>

<p>M. Sazonof replied by telegraph that the British Ambassador at St.
Petersburg, Sir George Buchanan, had asked him if the Russian Government
thought it desirable for Great Britain to take the initiative in
convoking a conference in London of the four powers.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"I replied that I have begun conversations with the
     Austro-Hungarian Ambassador under conditions which, I hope, may
     be favorable. I have not, however, received as yet any reply to
     the proposal made by me for revising the note between the two
     Cabinets.</p>

     <p>"If direct explanations with the Vienna Cabinet were to prove
     impossible, I am ready to accept the British proposal, or any
     other proposal of a kind that would bring about a favorable
     solution of the conflict.</p>

     <p>"I wish, however, to put an end from this day forth to a
     misunderstanding which might arise from the answer given by the
     French Minister of Justice to the German Ambassador, regarding
     counsels of moderation to be given to the Imperial [Russian]
     Cabinet."</p>
</div>

<p>This telegram Benckendorff communicated to Grey on the following day.</p>

<p>M. Sazonof telegraphed to the Russian Ambassadors at Paris, London,
Berlin, Vienna, and Rome that the Serbian reply exceeded expectations in
its moderation and desire to afford the fullest satisfaction.</p>

     <p class="quote">"We do not see what further demands could be made by Austria,
     unless the Vienna Cabinet is seeking for a pretext for war with
     Serbia."</p>

<p>M. Isvolsky, Russian Ambassador at Paris, telegraphed to M. Sazonof that
the German Ambassador, Baron von Schoen, had confirmed his declaration
of yesterday in writing, i.e.:</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"1. That Austria has declared to Russia that she seeks no
     territorial acquisitions and that she harbors no designs against
     the integrity of Serbia. Her sole object is to secure her own
     peace and quiet.</p>

     <p>"2. That consequently it rests with Russia to avoid war.</p>

     <p>"3. That Germany and France, entirely at one in their ardent
     desire to preserve peace, should exercise their moderating
     influence upon Russia.</p>

     <p>"Baron von Schoen laid special emphasis on the expression of
     solidarity of Germany and France. The Minister of Justice is
     convinced that these <span class="pagenum"><a id="page415" name="page415"></a>(p. 415)</span> steps on the part of Germany are
     taken with the evident object of alienating Russia and France, of
     inducing the French Government to make representations at St.
     Petersburg, and of thus compromising our ally in our eyes; and
     finally, in the event of war, of throwing the responsibility not
     on Germany, who is ostensibly making every effort to maintain
     peace, but on Russia and France."</p>
</div>

<p>In a supplementary telegram M. Isvolsky stated that the telegram from
Belgrade to Paris, giving the Serbian reply to the Austrian note was
delayed twenty hours, and that the telegram from the French Foreign
Office containing instructions to support Russia's representations,
which had been sent at the special urgent rate at 11 a. m., July 25,
1914, only reached its destination at 6 p. m.</p>

     <p class="quote">"There is no doubt that this telegram was intentionally delayed
     by the Austrian telegraph office."</p>

<p>M. Isvolsky telegraphed to M. Sazonof:</p>

     <p class="quote">"The Austrian Ambassador [Count Szécsen] has informed the Acting
     Minister for Foreign Affairs [M. Bienvenu-Martin] that to-morrow,
     Tuesday, Austria will proceed to take 'energetic action' with the
     object of forcing Serbia to give the necessary guaranties. The
     minister having asked what form such action would take, the
     ambassador replied that he had no exact information on the
     subject, but it might mean either the crossing of the Serbian
     frontier, or an ultimatum, or even a declaration of war."</p>

<p>M. Broniewsky, Russian Chargé d'Affaires at Berlin, telegraphed M.
Sazonof:</p>

     <p class="quote">"I begged the Minister for Foreign Affairs [Von Jagow] to support
     your proposal in Vienna that Szápáry [Austro-Hungarian Ambassador
     at St. Petersburg] should be authorized to draw up, by means of a
     private exchange of views with you, a wording of the
     Austro-Hungarian demands which would be acceptable to both
     parties. Jagow answered that he was aware of this proposal and
     that he agreed with Pourtalès [German Ambassador at St.
     Petersburg] that, as Szápáry had begun this conversation, he
     might as well go on with it. He will telegraph in this sense to
     the German Ambassador at Vienna. I begged him to press Vienna
     with greater insistence to adopt this conciliatory line; Jagow
     answered that he could not advise Austria to give way."</p>

<p>In a second telegram M. Broniewsky gave an account of an interview just
held between Von Jagow and the French Ambassador, M. Jules Cambon:</p>

     <p class="quote">"Cambon endeavored to induce Von Jagow to accept the British
     proposal for action in favor of peace to be taken simultaneously
     at St. Petersburg and at Vienna by Great Britain, Germany, Italy,
     and France. Cambon <span class="pagenum"><a id="page416" name="page416"></a>(p. 416)</span> suggested that these powers should
     give their advice to Vienna in the following terms: 'To abstain
     from all action which might aggravate the existing situation.' By
     adopting this vague formula, all mention of the necessity of
     refraining from invading Serbia might be avoided. Jagow refused
     point blank to accept this suggestion in spite of the entreaties
     of the ambassador, who emphasized, as a good feature of the
     suggestion, the mixed grouping of the powers, thanks to which the
     opposition between the Alliance and the Entente&mdash;a matter of
     which Jagow himself had often complained&mdash;was avoided."</p>

<p>Nicholas II telegraphed his reply to the appeal for Russian aid made by
Prince Alexander of Serbia on July 25, 1914. It assured the prince of
the Czar's cordial sympathy with the Serbian people.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"The existing situation is engaging my most serious attention,
     and my government are using their utmost endeavor to smooth away
     the present difficulties. I have no doubt that your highness and
     the Royal Serbian Government wish to render that task easy by
     neglecting no step which might lead to a settlement, and thus
     both prevent the horrors of a new war and safeguard the dignity
     of Serbia.</p>

     <p>"So long as the slightest hope exists of avoiding bloodshed, all
     our efforts must be directed to that end; but if in spite of our
     earnest wish we are not successful, your highness may rest
     assured that Russia will in no case disinterest herself in the
     fate of Serbia."</p>
</div>

<p>M. Schebeko, Russian Ambassador at Vienna, telegraphed to M. Sazonof of
a conversation he had had in the absence of Count Berchtold, Minister
for Foreign Affairs, with Baron Macchio, the Under-Secretary.</p>

     <p class="quote">"I drew his attention to the unfavorable impression produced in
     Russia by the presentation of demands by Austria to Serbia, which
     it was quite impossible for any independent state, however small,
     to accept. I added that this method of procedure might lead to
     the most undesirable complications, and that it had aroused
     profound surprise and general condemnation in Russia. We can only
     suppose that Austria, influenced by the assurances given by the
     German representative at Vienna, who has egged her on throughout
     this crisis, has counted on the probable localization of the
     dispute with Serbia, and on the possibility of inflicting with
     impunity a serious blow upon that country. The declaration by the
     Russian Government that Russia could not possibly remain
     indifferent in the face of such conduct has caused a great
     sensation here."</p>

<p>Count Benckendorff, Russian Ambassador at London, telegraphed to M.
Sazonof:</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"Grey has just informed the German Ambassador, who came to
     question him as to the possibility of taking action at St.
     Petersburg, that such action <span class="pagenum"><a id="page417" name="page417"></a>(p. 417)</span> ought rather to be taken
     at Vienna, and that the Berlin Cabinet were the best qualified to
     do so. Grey also pointed out that the Serbian reply to the
     Austrian note had exceeded anything that could have been expected
     in moderation and in its spirit of conciliation. Grey added that
     he had therefore come to the conclusion that Russia must have
     advised Belgrade to return a moderate reply, and that he thought
     the Serbian reply could form the basis of a peaceful and
     acceptable solution of the question.</p>

     <p>"In these circumstances, continued Grey, if Austria were to begin
     hostilities in spite of that reply, she would prove her intention
     of crushing Serbia. Looked at in this light, the question might
     give rise to a situation which might lead to a war in which all
     the powers would be involved.</p>

     <p>"Grey finally declared that the British Government were sincerely
     anxious to act with the German Government as long as the
     preservation of peace was in question; but, in the contrary
     event, Great Britain reserved to herself full liberty of action."</p>
</div>

<p><i>Great Britain.</i> Sir Maurice de Bunsen, Ambassador at Vienna,
telegraphed to Sir Edward Grey, Secretary for Foreign Affairs at London,
that he had consulted with his colleagues about the mediation of the
four powers, and the impression was that the note to Serbia was
intentionally drawn to make war inevitable, and, until Serbia had been
punished, no proposals for mediation would be listened to.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"This country has gone wild with joy at the prospect of war with
     Serbia, and its postponement or prevention would undoubtedly be a
     great disappointment.</p>

     <p>"I propose, subject to any special directions you desire to send
     me, to express to the Austrian Minister for Foreign Affairs the
     hope of his majesty's Government that it may yet be possible to
     avoid war, and to ask his excellency whether he cannot suggest a
     way out even now."</p>
</div>

<p>Sir Francis Bertie, Ambassador at Paris, telegraphed to Grey that France
had accepted his proposal for the four-power mediation, and sent the
necessary instructions to her representatives at Belgrade, Vienna, and
St. Petersburg.</p>

     <p class="quote">"Instructions have been sent to the French Ambassador at Berlin
     to concert with his British colleague as to the advisability of
     their speaking jointly to the German Government. Until it is
     known that the Germans have spoken at Vienna with some success,
     it would, in the opinion of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, be
     dangerous for the French, Russian, and British Ambassadors to do
     so."</p>

<p>Sir Edward Goschen, Ambassador at Berlin, telegraphed to Grey:</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"Secretary of State [Von Jagow] says that conference you suggest
     would practically amount to a court of arbitration and could not,
     in his opinion, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page418" name="page418"></a>(p. 418)</span> be called together except at the
     request of Austria and Russia. He could not therefore fall in
     with your suggestion, desirous though he was to cooperate for the
     maintenance of peace. I said I was sure that your idea had
     nothing to do with arbitration, but meant that representatives of
     the four nations not directly interested should discuss and
     suggest means for avoiding a dangerous situation. He maintained,
     however, that such a conference as you proposed was not
     practicable. He added that news he had just received from St.
     Petersburg showed that there was an intention on the part of M.
     de Sazonof [Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs] to exchange
     views with Count Berchtold [Austro-Hungarian Minister for Foreign
     Affairs]. He thought that this method of procedure might lead to
     a satisfactory result, and that it would be best, before doing
     anything else, to await outcome of the exchange of views between
     the Austrian and Russian Governments.</p>

     <p>"In the course of a short conversation Secretary of State said
     that as yet Austria was only partially mobilizing, but that if
     Russia mobilized against Germany latter would have to follow
     suit. I asked him what he meant by 'mobilizing against Germany.'
     He said that if Russia only mobilized in south, Germany would not
     mobilize, but if she mobilized in north, Germany would have to do
     so too, and Russian system of mobilization was so complicated
     that it might be difficult exactly to locate her mobilization.
     Germany would therefore have to be very careful not to be taken
     by surprise.</p>

     <p>"Finally, Secretary of State said that news from St. Petersburg
     had caused him to take more hopeful view of the general
     situation."</p>
</div>

<p>Sir George Buchanan, Ambassador at St. Petersburg, telegraphed Grey an
account of the interview between M. Sazonof, Russian Minister for
Foreign Affairs, and Count Szápáry, the Austro-Hungarian Ambassador, in
which Sazonof had pointed out that Austria's demands entailed entire
revision of existing Serbian laws, and were moreover incompatible with
Serbia's dignity as an independent state; and that it would be useless
for Russia, being an object of suspicion in Austria, to offer her good
offices.</p>

     <p class="quote">"In order, however, to put an end to the present tension, he
     thought that England and Italy might be willing to collaborate
     with Austria."</p>

<p>Sir George told M. Sazonof that Grey could do nothing more than he had
promised on the 24th inst., and that the Russian Minister was mistaken
if he believed that peace would be promoted by Great Britain telling
Germany it would have to deal with her as well as with Russia and France
if it supported Austria by force of arms.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page419" name="page419"></a>(p. 419)</span> "Their attitude would merely be stiffened by such a
     menace, and we could only induce Germany to use her influence at
     Vienna to avert war by approaching her in the capacity of a
     friend who was anxious to preserve peace. His excellency must
     not, if our efforts were to be successful, do anything to
     precipitate a conflict. I trusted that the Russian Government
     would defer mobilization ukase for as long as possible, and that
     troops would not be allowed to cross the frontier even when it
     was issued.</p>

     <p>"The Minister for Foreign Affairs replied that, until the issue
     of the imperial ukase, no effective steps toward mobilization
     could be taken, and the Austro-Hungarian Government would profit
     by delay in order to complete her military preparations if it
     were deferred too long."</p>
</div>

<p>In a supplementary telegram Buchanan reported that M. Sazonof had
proposed</p>

     <p class="quote">"that the modifications to be introduced into Austrian demands
     should be the subject of direct conversation between Vienna and
     St. Petersburg."</p>

<p>Grey telegraphed to Sir Eward Goschen, British Ambassador at Berlin,
that Prince Lichnowsky, the German Ambassador at London, had informed
him that Germany accepted in principle the four-power mediation,
reserving its right as ally to help Austria if attacked.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"He has also been instructed to request me to use influence in
     St. Petersburg to localize the war and to keep up the peace of
     Europe.</p>

     <p>"I have replied that the Serbian reply went further than could
     have been expected to meet the Austrian demands. German Secretary
     of State [Von Jagow] has himself said that there were some things
     in the Austrian note that Serbia could hardly be expected to
     accept. I assumed that Serbian reply could not have gone as far
     as it did unless Russia had exercised conciliatory influence at
     Belgrade, and it was really at Vienna that moderating influence
     was now required. If Austria put the Serbian reply aside as being
     worth nothing and marched into Serbia, it meant that she was
     determined to crush Serbia at all costs, being reckless of the
     consequences that might be involved. Serbian reply should at
     least be treated as a basis for discussion and pause. I said
     German Government should urge this at Vienna.</p>

     <p>"I recalled what German Government had said as to the gravity of
     the situation if the war could not be localized, and observed
     that if Germany assisted Austria against Russia it would be
     because, without any reference to the merits of the dispute,
     Germany could not afford to see Austria crushed. Just so other
     issues might be raised that would supersede the dispute between
     Austria and Serbia, and would bring other powers in, and the war
     would be the biggest ever known; but as long as Germany would
     work to keep the peace I would keep closely in touch. I repeated
     that after the Serbian reply it was at Vienna that some
     moderation must be urged."</p>
</div>

<p>Grey telegraphed Buchanan at St. Petersburg, referring him to the above,
and informing him that the Russian Ambassador <span class="pagenum"><a id="page420" name="page420"></a>(p. 420)</span> at London, Count
Benckendorff had told him [Grey] that the impression prevailed in German
and Austrian circles that Great Britain would stand aside in event of
war. This the Ambassador deplored for its adverse effect on peace.</p>

<p>Grey informed Sir Maurice de Bunsen, British Ambassador at Vienna, of
his interview just held with Count Mensdorff, Austro-Hungarian
Ambassador at London.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"Mensdorff said that the Austrian Government, very reluctantly
     and against their wish, were compelled to take more severe
     measures to enforce a fundamental change of the attitude of
     enmity pursued up to now by Serbia.... We would understand that
     the Austrian Government must consider that the moment had arrived
     to obtain, by means of the strongest pressure, guaranties for the
     definite suppression of the Serbian aspirations and for the
     security of peace and order on the southeastern frontier of
     Austria.</p>

     <p>"As the peaceable means to this effect were exhausted, the
     Austrian Government must at last appeal to force. Their action,
     which had no sort of aggressive tendency, could not be
     represented otherwise than as self-defense. Also they thought
     that they would serve a European interest if they prevented
     Serbia from being henceforth an element of general unrest such as
     she had been for the last ten years. The high sense of justice of
     the British nation and of British statesmen could not blame the
     Austrian Government if the latter defended by the sword what was
     theirs, and cleared up their position with a country whose
     hostile policy had forced upon them for years measures so costly
     as to have gravely injured Austrian national prosperity. Finally,
     the Austrian Government, confiding in their amicable relations
     with us, felt that they could count on our sympathy in a fight
     that was forced on them, and on our assistance in localizing the
     fight, if necessary.</p>

     <p>"Count Mensdorff added on his own account that, as long as Serbia
     was confronted with Turkey, Austria never took very severe
     measures because of her adherence to the policy of the free
     development of the Balkan States. Now that Serbia had doubled her
     territory and population without any Austrian interference, the
     repression of Serbian subversive aims was a matter of
     self-defense and self-preservation on Austria's part. He
     reiterated that Austria had no intention of taking Serbian
     territory or aggressive designs against Serbian territory.</p>

     <p>"I said that I could not understand the construction put by the
     Austrian Government upon the Serbian reply, and I told Count
     Mensdorff the substance of the conversation that I had had with
     the German Ambassador this morning about that reply.</p>

     <p>"Count Mensdorff admitted that, on paper, the Serbian reply might
     seem to be satisfactory; but the Serbians had refused the one
     thing&mdash;the cooperation of Austrian officials and police&mdash;which
     would be a real guaranty that in practice the Serbians would not
     carry on their subversive campaign against Austria.</p>

     <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page421" name="page421"></a>(p. 421)</span> "I said that it seemed to me as if the Austrian
     Government believed that, even after the Serbian reply, they
     could make war upon Serbia anyhow, without risk of bringing
     Russia into the dispute. If they could make war on Serbia and at
     the same time satisfy Russia, well and good; but, if not, the
     consequences would be incalculable. I pointed out to him that I
     quoted this phrase from an expression of the views of the German
     Government. I feared that it would be expected in St. Petersburg
     that the Serbian reply would diminish the tension, and now, when
     Russia found that there was increased tension, the situation
     would become increasingly serious. Already the effect on Europe
     was one of anxiety. I pointed out [as an instance of this] that
     our fleet was to have dispersed to-day, but we had felt unable to
     let it disperse. We should not think of calling up reserves at
     this moment, and there was no menace in what we had done about
     our fleet; but, owing to the possibility of a European
     conflagration, it was impossible for us to disperse our forces at
     this moment. It seemed to me that the Serbian reply already
     involved the greatest humiliation to Serbia that I had ever seen
     a country undergo, and it was disappointing to me that the reply
     was treated by the Austrian Government as if it were as
     unsatisfactory as a blank negative."</p>
</div>

<p>Grey informed Sir Rennell Rodd, British Ambassador at Rome, that the
Italian Ambassador at London had stated to Sir Arthur Nicholson,
Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, that Italy agreed to the four-power
conference, and that the Marquis di San Giuliano, Italian Minister for
Foreign Affairs, would recommend to Germany the suggestion that Russia,
Austria-Hungary, and Serbia should suspend military operations pending
result of the conference, and would inquire what procedure Germany
proposed to be followed at Vienna.</p>

<p>Sir Francis Bertie, Ambassador at Paris, sent Grey a memorandum of M.
Bienvenu-Martin's, French Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, as to
steps to be taken to prevent hostilities between Austria-Hungary and
Serbia.</p>

<p>M. Jules Cambon, French Ambassador at Berlin, has been requested to act
in concert with the British Ambassador there in Grey's plan. M. Paul
Cambon, Ambassador at London, has been appointed France's representative
in the four-power conference. France is ready to instruct her
representatives at St. Petersburg, Vienna, and Belgrade to induce these
governments to abstain from hostilities pending the results of the
conference.</p>

<p>But M. Bienvenu-Martin considers success of the conference <span class="pagenum"><a id="page422" name="page422"></a>(p. 422)</span>
depends on the action Berlin is willing to take at Vienna beforehand.</p>

<p>Sir George Buchanan, Ambassador at St. Petersburg, telegraphed to Grey
an account of an interview just had with M. Sazonof, Minister for
Foreign Affairs. Sazonof was conciliatory and optimistic.</p>

     <p class="quote">"Sazonof said he was perfectly ready to stand aside if the powers
     accepted the proposal for a conference, but he trusted that you
     would keep in touch with the Russian Ambassador in the event of
     its taking place."</p>

<p><i>France.</i> M. Farges, Consul General at Basle, Switzerland, reported to
M. Bienvenu-Martin, Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs at Paris, that
German officers on leave in this district had been ordered to return to
Germany, and that owners of motor cars in Baden had been ordered to be
ready to place them at the disposal of the Government, and secrecy
enjoined as to the order under penalty of fine. People at Basle are
uneasy, and banking facilities restricted.</p>

<p>M. de Fleuriau, Chargé d'Affaires at London, reported to M.
Bienvenu-Martin that the German and Austrian Ambassadors there were
letting it appear that they were sure Great Britain would preserve
neutrality in case of war. Sir Arthur Nicholson, Under-Secretary for
Foreign Affairs, had, however, assured Prince Lichnowsky, the German
Ambassador, that Great Britain was free to intervene if she judged it
expedient. To make this understood in Germany, nevertheless, that
Government should be made to know for certain that they will find Great
Britain by the side of France and Russia.</p>

<p>M. Paléologue, Ambassador at St. Petersburg, telegraphed that M.
Sazonof, Minister for Foreign Affairs, was using conciliatory language
to the ambassadors, and was restraining the press, particularly in
recommending great moderation toward Germany.</p>

<p>M. Bompard, Ambassador at Constantinople, telegraphed from Therapia that
the Turks were delighted at the misfortunes of Serbia, and thought that
Russia will not intervene in her favor under circumstances which would
extend the war beyond Serbia and Austria.</p>

     <p class="quote"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page423" name="page423"></a>(p. 423)</span> "The unanimous feeling in Ottoman political circles is
     that Austria, with the support of Germany, will attain her
     objects, and that she will make Serbia follow Bulgaria and enter
     into the orbit of the Triple Alliance."</p>

<p>M. de Fleuriau, Chargé d'Affaires at London, reported the interview
between Sir Edward Grey, Secretary of Foreign Affairs, and Prince
Lichnowsky, German Ambassador.</p>

     <p class="quote">"The attitude of Great Britain is confirmed by the postponement
     of the demobilization of the fleet. The First Lord of the
     Admiralty [Winston Churchill] took this measure quietly on Friday
     on his own initiative; to-night Sir Edward Grey and his
     colleagues decided to make it public. This result is due to the
     conciliatory attitude of Serbia and Russia."</p>

<p>M. de Fleuriau, Chargé d'Affaires at London, reported news from St.
Petersburg of the willingness of Russia to stand aside if Serbia
appealed to the powers. Accordingly Sir Edward Grey will proceed with
his plan of a conference, on the understanding that, pending its
results, Russia, Austria, and Serbia abstain from active military
operations. To this the German Ambassador, Prince Lichnowsky is
favorably disposed. Later M. de Fleuriau reported that the Serbian
Minister at London, M. Boschkovitch, had not yet received instructions
to ask for British mediation. Possibly telegrams to that effect had been
stopped on the way.</p>

<p>M. Bienvenu-Martin having received Sir Edward Grey's proposal for the
four-power conference, authorized M. de Fleuriau to represent France in
it. He repeated his conviction of failure of the conference unless
Germany's influence were first exercised pacifically at Vienna.</p>

     <p class="quote">"I have also noted, during Baron von Schoen's observations, that
     the Austro-Hungarian Government was particularly susceptible when
     the words 'mediation,' 'intervention,' 'conference' were used,
     and was more willing to admit 'friendly advice' and
     'conversations.'"</p>

<p>De Fleuriau reported that Italy had accepted intervention by the powers
to prevent military operations. Germany had not yet replied to Italy's
request for information as to procedure to be followed with regard to
Austria-Hungary.</p>

<p>M. Barrère, Ambassador at Rome, reported his interview with the Marquis
di San Giuliano, in which that Minister for Foreign Affairs had
repudiated his reported approval of the action of Austria-Hungary.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page424" name="page424"></a>(p. 424)</span> "He is convinced that Austria will not withdraw any of
     her claims, and will maintain them, even at the risk of bringing
     about a general conflagration; he doubts whether Germany is
     disposed to lend herself to any pressure on her ally. He asserts,
     however, that Germany at this moment attaches great importance to
     her relations with London, and he believes that if any power can
     determine Berlin in favor of peaceful action, it is England.</p>

     <p>"As for Italy she will continue to make every effort in favor of
     peace. It is with this end in view that he had adhered without
     hesitation to Sir Edward Grey's proposal for a meeting in London
     of the ambassadors of those powers which are not directly
     interested in the Austro-Serbian dispute."</p>
</div>

<p>M. Jules Cambon, Ambassador at Berlin, reported the interview of Sir
Edward Goschen, the British Ambassador, with the German Secretary of
State, and said that Herr von Jagow's language confirmed that of Baron
von Schoen at Paris.</p>

<p>M. Bienvenu-Martin then notified the French Ambassadors at London, St.
Petersburg, Berlin, Vienna, and Rome, of his interview with Count
Szécsen, the Austro-Hungarian Ambassador, and the memorandum he had
submitted criticizing the Serbian reply to the Austrian note.</p>

<p><i>Belgium.</i> Baron Beyens, Minister at Berlin, reported to M. Davignon,
Minister for Foreign Affairs at Brussels, the diplomatic situation at
the German capital. Germany had not replied to the British proposal.
"The decision rests with the emperor."</p>


<h3>TUESDAY, JULY 28, 1914</h3>

<p><i>Serbia.</i> Count Berchtold, Austro-Hungarian Minister for Foreign
Affairs, this day telegraphed to M. Pashitch, Serbian Prime Minister,
that Serbia's reply to the Austrian note being unsatisfactory, the
Austro-Hungarian Government</p>

     <p class="quote">"was compelled to see to the safeguarding of their rights and
     interests, and, with this object, to have recourse to force of
     arms. Austria-Hungary consequently considers herself henceforward
     in a state of war with Serbia."</p>

<p>M. Pashitch telegraphed this news from Nish to all the Serbian Legations
abroad.</p>

<p>Dr. M. Spalaikovitch, Serbian Minister at Petrograd, gave the
information officially to M. Sazonof, Russian Minister for Foreign
Affairs.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page425" name="page425"></a>(p. 425)</span> "I have the honor to inform your excellency of this
     regrettable act, which a great power had the courage to commit
     against a small Slav country which only recently emerged from a
     long series of heroic but exhausting battles, and I beg leave on
     this occasion of deep gravity for my country to express the hope
     that this act, which disturbs the peace of Europe and revolts her
     conscience, will be condemned by the whole civilized world and
     severely punished by Russia, the protector of Serbia.</p>

     <p>"I beg your excellency to be so kind as to lay this petition from
     the whole Serbian nation before the throne of his majesty."</p>
</div>

<p><i>Austria-Hungary.</i> An official communication was given to the press at
Vienna summarizing the Government's criticism of the Serbian reply to
the Austro-Hungarian note.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"Inasmuch as the Austro-Hungarian demands constitute the minimum
     regarded as necessary for the reestablishment of a permanent
     peace in the southeast of the [Dual] Monarchy, the Serbian reply
     is considered to be insufficient.</p>

     <p>"That the Serbian Government is aware of this appears from the
     fact that they contemplate the settlement of the dispute by
     arbitration, and also from the fact that on the day on which
     their reply was due, and before it was in fact submitted, they
     gave orders for mobilization."</p>
</div>

<p>Count Szögyény, Austro-Hungarian Ambassador at Berlin, telegraphed to
Count Berchtold that Germany had declined to take part in the four
power-conference</p>

     <p class="quote">"on the ground that it is impossible for Germany to bring her
     ally before a European court in her settlement with Serbia."</p>

<p>Baron von Müller telegraphed to Count Berchtold from Tokyo, Japan, that
the semiofficial Japan "Times" concludes a leading article on the
Serbian question with the statement that Japan is on the best of terms
with the three great powers concerned, Austria-Hungary, Germany, and
Russia, while it is in no way interested in Serbia. He infers that, in
case of war, Japan would, as a matter of course, maintain strict
neutrality.</p>

<p>Count Berchtold telegraphed Count Szögyény at Berlin the report made by
Count Mensdorff, Austro-Hungarian Ambassador at London, of his interview
on the 27th with Sir Edward Grey.</p>

     <p class="quote">"I believe that I need not specially point out to your excellency
     that Grey's proposal for a conference, in so far as it relates to
     our conflict with Serbia, appears, in view of the state of war
     which has arisen, to have been outstripped by events."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page426" name="page426"></a>(p. 426)</span> Count Berchtold telegraphed Count Mensdorff in London to
explain to Sir Edward Grey in detail the <i>dossier</i> of charges against
Serbia accompanying the Austrian note, and</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"make clear to him that the offer of Serbia to meet points in our
     note was only an apparent one, intended to deceive Europe without
     giving any guaranty for the future.</p>

     <p>"As the Serbian Government knew that only an unconditional
     acceptance of our demands could satisfy us, the Serbian tactics
     can easily be seen through: Serbia accepted a number of our
     demands, with all sorts of reservations, in order to impress
     public opinion in Europe, trusting that she would not be required
     to fulfill her promises. In conversing with Sir Edward Grey, your
     excellency should lay special emphasis on the circumstance that
     the general mobilization of the Serbian army was ordered for the
     afternoon of July 25 at three o'clock, while the answer to our
     note was delivered just before the expiration of the time
     fixed&mdash;that is to say, a few minutes before six o'clock. Up to
     then we had made no military preparations, but by the Serbian
     mobilization we were compelled to do so."</p>
</div>

<p>Count Berchtold telegraphed to Count Szápáry, Ambassador at St.
Petersburg, an account of an interview with the Russian Ambassador at
Vienna. Count Berchtold had informed M. Schebeko of Austria-Hungary's
inability to concur in Russia's proposal to take the Serbian reply to
the Austrian note as a starting point for an understanding between the
disputants.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"No one in our country could understand, nor could anyone approve
     negotiations with reference to the wording used in the answer
     which we had designated as unsatisfactory. This was all the more
     impossible because, as the ambassador knew, there was a deep
     feeling of general excitement which had already mastered public
     opinion. Moreover, on our side war had to-day been declared
     against Serbia.</p>

     <p>"In reply to the explanations of the ambassador, which culminated
     in asserting that we should not in any way suppress the admitted
     hostile opinion in Serbia by a warlike action, but that, on the
     contrary, we should only increase it, I gave him some insight
     into our present relations toward Serbia which made it necessary,
     quite against our will, and without any selfish secondary object,
     for us to show our restless neighbor, with the necessary
     emphasis, our firm intention not to permit any longer a movement
     which was allowed to exist by the Government, and which was
     directed against the existence of the [Dual] Monarchy. The
     attitude of Serbia after the receipt of our note had further not
     been calculated to make a peaceful solution possible, because
     Serbia, even before she transmitted to us her unsatisfactory
     reply, had ordered a general mobilization, and in so doing had
     already committed a hostile act against us. In spite of this,
     however, we had waited for three days. Yesterday hostilities were
     opened against us on the Hungarian frontier on the part of
     Serbia. By this act <span class="pagenum"><a id="page427" name="page427"></a>(p. 427)</span> we were deprived of the possibility
     of maintaining any longer the patience which we had shown toward
     Serbia. The establishment of a fundamental but peaceful
     amelioration of our relations toward Serbia had now been made
     impossible, and we were compelled to meet the Serbian provocation
     in the only form which in the given circumstances was consistent
     with the dignity of the monarchy."</p>
</div>

<p>Count Berchtold telegraphed to Count Mensdorff in London of his
interview with Sir Maurice de Bunsen, British Ambassador in Vienna.
Bunsen had explained Sir Edward Grey's position.</p>

<p>Count Berchtold telegraphed Count Szögyény at Berlin to communicate to
the German Chancellor or Secretary of State the following information:</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"According to mutually consistent reports, received from St.
     Petersburg, Kiev, Warsaw, Moscow, and Odessa, Russia is making
     extensive military preparations. M. Sazonof has indeed given an
     assurance on his word of honor, as has also the Russian Minister
     of War, that mobilization has not up to now been ordered; the
     latter has, however, told the German Military Attaché that the
     military districts which border on Austria-Hungary&mdash;Kiev, Odessa,
     Moscow, and Kazan&mdash;will be mobilized should our troops cross the
     Serbian frontier.</p>

     <p>"Under these circumstances I would urgently ask the Cabinet at
     Berlin to take into immediate consideration the question whether
     the attention of Russia should not be drawn, in a friendly
     manner, to the fact that the mobilization of the above districts
     amounts to a threat against Austria-Hungary, and that, therefore,
     should these measures be carried out, they would be answered by
     the most extensive military countermeasures, not only by the
     [Dual] Monarchy but by our ally, the German Empire.</p>

     <p>"In order to make it more easy for Russia to withdraw, it appears
     to us appropriate that such a step should, in the first place, be
     taken by Germany alone; nevertheless we are ready to take this
     step in conjunction with Germany.</p>

     <p>"Unambiguous language appears to me at the present moment to be
     the most effective method of making Russia fully conscious of all
     that is involved in a threatening attitude."</p>
</div>

<p><i>Russia.</i> Consul General at Fiume telegraphed to M. Sazonof, Minister
for Foreign Affairs at St. Petersburg, that a state of siege had been
proclaimed in Slavonia, in Croatia, and at Fiume, and reservists of all
classes called out.</p>

<p>M. Broniewsky, Chargé d'Affaires at Berlin, telegraphed M. Sazonof that
the local papers had not published <i>in extenso</i> the Serbian reply,
evidently being well aware of the calming effect it would have on German
readers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page428" name="page428"></a>(p. 428)</span> M. Schebeko, Ambassador at Vienna, telegraphed that the
Austro-Hungarian order for general mobilization had been signed.</p>

<p>M. Sazonof telegraphed the ambassadors at London, Paris, Berlin, Vienna,
and Rome:</p>

     <p class="quote">"In face of the hostilities between Austria-Hungary and Serbia,
     it is necessary that Great Britain should take instant mediatory
     action, and that the military measures undertaken by Austria
     against Serbia should be immediately suspended. Otherwise
     mediation will only serve as an excuse to make the question drag
     on, and will meanwhile make it possible for Austria to crush
     Serbia completely and to acquire a dominant position in the
     Balkans."</p>

<p><i>Germany.</i> The Chancellor, Dr. von Bethmann-Hollweg, confidentially
reported to the Government of Germany that the evidence presented by
Austria-Hungary was conclusive of the complicity in the crime of
Sarajevo of members of the Serbian Government and army, and the
existence of organized Serb propaganda against the Dual Monarchy.
Austria-Hungary therefore was justified in her action as well as demands
against Serbia.</p>

<p>The Chancellor telegraphed to Count Pourtalès, Ambassador at St.
Petersburg:</p>

     <p class="quote">"We continue in our endeavor to induce Vienna to elucidate in St.
     Petersburg the object and scope of the Austrian action in Serbia
     in a manner both convincing and satisfactory to Russia. The
     declaration of war which has meanwhile ensued alters nothing in
     this matter."</p>

<p>Count Berchtold, Minister for Foreign Affairs in Vienna, telegraphed to
the German Chancellor that the British mediation proposal, "owing to the
opening of hostilities by Serbia," was "belated." William II at 10. 45
p. m., sent the following message to Nicholas II:</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"I have heard with the greatest anxiety of the impression which
     is caused by the action of Austria-Hungary against Serbia. The
     unscrupulous agitation which has been going on for years in
     Serbia has led to the revolting crime of which Archduke Franz
     Ferdinand has become a victim. The spirit which made the Serbians
     murder their own king and his consort still dominates that
     country. Doubtless you will agree with me that both of us, you as
     well as I, and all other sovereigns, have a common interest to
     insist that all those who are responsible for this horrible
     murder shall suffer their deserved punishment.</p>

     <p>"On the other hand, I by no means overlook the difficulty
     encountered by you and your Government to stem the tide of public
     opinion. In view <span class="pagenum"><a id="page429" name="page429"></a>(p. 429)</span> of the cordial friendship which has
     joined us both for a long time with firm ties, I shall use my
     entire influence to induce Austria-Hungary to obtain a frank and
     satisfactory understanding with Russia. I hope confidently that
     you will support me in my efforts to overcome all difficulties
     which may yet arise.</p>

     <p>"Your most sincere and devoted friend and cousin."</p>
</div>

<p><i>Great Britain.</i> Sir Maurice de Bunsen, Ambassador at Vienna, sent to
Sir Edward Grey, Secretary for Foreign Affairs at London, the text of
the Austro-Hungarian declaration of war against Serbia. This was
followed by the statements:</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"Austria-Hungary, who has just addressed to Serbia a formal
     declaration, in conformity with Article I of the convention of
     October 18, 1907, relative to the opening of hostilities,
     considers herself henceforward in a state of war with Serbia.</p>

     <p>"In bringing the above to notice of his Britannic Majesty's
     embassy, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs has the honor to
     declare that Austria-Hungary will act during the hostilities in
     conformity with the terms of the conventions of the The Hague of
     October 18, 1907, as also with those of the Declaration of London
     of February 28, 1909, provided an analogous procedure is adopted
     by Serbia."</p>
</div>

<p>The French Embassy informed Sir Edward Grey that France accepted his
four-power mediation proposal, and had appointed M. Paul Cambon her
representative in the conference.</p>

<p>Count Benckendorff, Russian Ambassador at London, communicated to Grey a
telegram from M. Sazonof, Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, which
stated that his interviews with the German Ambassador, Count Pourtalès,
confirmed his impression that Germany would support Austria-Hungary's
uncompromising attitude.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"The Berlin Cabinet, who could have prevented the whole of this
     crisis developing, appear to be exerting no influence on their
     ally....</p>

     <p>"This attitude of the German Government is most alarming.</p>

     <p>"It seems to me that Great Britain is in a better position than
     any other power to make another attempt at Berlin to induce the
     German Government to take the necessary action. There is no doubt
     that the key of the situation is to be found at Berlin."</p>
</div>

<p>Sir Francis Bertie, Ambassador at Paris, telegraphed Grey that M.
Bienvenu-Martin, Acting Secretary for Foreign Affairs, realized the
position of Great Britain.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"He quite appreciates the impossibility for his [British]
     majesty's Government to declare themselves 'solidaires' with
     Russia on a question between Austria and Serbia, which in its
     present condition is not one <span class="pagenum"><a id="page430" name="page430"></a>(p. 430)</span> affecting England. He also
     sees that you cannot take up an attitude at Berlin and Vienna
     more Serbian than that attributed in German and Austrian sources
     to the Russian Government.</p>

     <p>"The German Ambassador [Baron von Schoen] has stated that Austria
     would respect the integrity of Serbia, but when asked whether her
     independence also would be respected, he gave no assurance."</p>
</div>

<p>Sir Edward Goschen, Ambassador at Berlin, telegraphed that, after
conference with his French and Italian colleagues, he had found that the
German Secretary of State von Jagow had, while refusing to take part in
the proposed conference, said to all of them that he desired to work
with their Governments for the maintenance of general peace.</p>

     <p class="quote">"We therefore deduced that if he is sincere in this wish he can
     be objecting only to the form of your proposal. Perhaps he
     himself could be induced to suggest lines on which he would find
     it possible to work with us."</p>

<p>Maurice de Bunsen, Ambassador at Vienna, telegraphed that Count
Berchtold, Minister for Foreign Affairs, declared Austria-Hungary could
not delay military proceedings against Serbia, and so declined the
mediation proposed.</p>

     <p class="quote">"Prestige of [Dual] Monarchy was engaged, and nothing could now
     prevent conflict."</p>

<p>The Ambassador supplemented this in a longer telegram, giving details of
his interview with Count Berchtold.</p>

<p>Sir Rennell Rodd, Ambassador at Rome, telegraphed an account of an
interview the Marquis di San Giuliano, Prime Minister, had just had with
the Serbian Chargé d'Affaires.</p>

<p>If explanations were given of mode in which Austrian agents would
intervene under Articles V and VI of the note to Serbia, Serbia might
still accept the whole note. This explanation could be imparted, without
loss of dignity to Austria, through the powers, who might then advise
Serbia to accept the note without conditions.</p>

<p>The Marquis pointed out a passage in the Austrian note which had been
misinterpreted by Serbia, and so might be used as a basis for
settlement, namely, that regarding cooperation of Austrian agents in
Serbia; this was to be only in investigation, not in judicial or
administrative measures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page431" name="page431"></a>(p. 431)</span> Mr. Crackanthorpe, Chargé d'Affaires in Serbia, telegraphed
from Nish that he was urging greatest moderation on the Serbian
Government pending mediatory efforts by the powers.</p>

     <p class="quote">"Two Serbian steamers fired on and damaged, and two Serbian
     merchant vessels have been captured by a Hungarian monitor at
     Orsova."</p>

<p>This was supplemented by a telegram that war had been declared by
Austria.</p>

<p>Grey telegraphed to Sir Edward Goschen, Ambassador at Berlin, explaining
the nature of his proposed four-power conference. No suggestion would be
put forward that has not previously been ascertained to be acceptable to
Austria and Russia. A direct exchange of views between these countries
is preferable to all other methods. This the Russian Minister of Foreign
Affairs, M. Sazonof, is reported to have offered. If Austria accepts,
the situation will become less critical. Prince Lichnowsky, German
Ambassador at London, reports that his Government has counseled
moderation at Vienna. This is very satisfactory.</p>

<p>A supplementary telegram read:</p>

     <p class="quote">"German Government, having accepted principle of mediation
     between Austria and Russia by the four powers, if necessary, I am
     ready to propose that the German Secretary of State should
     suggest the lines on which this principle should be applied. I
     will, however, keep the idea in reserve until we see how the
     conversations between Austria and Russia progress."</p>

<p>Grey telegraphed to Sir George Buchanan, Ambassador at St. Petersburg,
his satisfaction over prospect of direct exchange of views between
Russia and Austria, and readiness to facilitate this if he knew what
Sazonof, Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, proposes that the
ministers at Belgrade do.</p>

     <p class="quote">"Could he not first mention in an exchange of views with Austria
     his willingness to cooperate in some such scheme? It might then
     take more concrete shape."</p>

<p>Sir Edward Goschen, Ambassador at Berlin, telegraphed report to Grey on
the 28th inst. of an interview with the German Chancellor, Dr. von
Bethmann-Hollweg. The Chancellor was most anxious for Germany and Great
Britain to work together for European peace, as they had successfully
done in last preceding crisis. He could not accept the four-power
proposal, since the conference would look like an "Areopagus" of two
groups of two <span class="pagenum"><a id="page432" name="page432"></a>(p. 432)</span> powers, each sitting in judgment on two other
powers, but this refusal should not militate against his strong desire
for effective cooperation. He was doing his best at Vienna and St.
Petersburg to get both powers into friendly direct discussion, but if,
as reported, Russia had mobilized fourteen army corps in the south, this
would put it out of his power to continue preaching moderation at
Vienna. Austria, who was only partially mobilizing, would have to take
similar measures; so, if war results, Russia will be responsible.</p>

<p>Goschen remarked that surely part of the responsibility rested on
Austria for refusing to accept the almost wholly compliant reply of
Serbia, or to admit it as a basis for discussion. The Chancellor
repeated his views about the Serbian question being wholly Austria's
affair, with which Russia had nothing to do.</p>

     <p class="quote">"Austrian colleague said to me to-day that a general war was most
     unlikely, as Russia neither wanted nor was in a position to make
     war. I think that that opinion is shared by many people here."</p>

<p>Ambassador Buchanan telegraphed from St. Petersburg report of interview
with M. Sazonof, the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, who thanked
Grey for his language to Prince Lichnowsky, the German Ambassador.
Sazonof was pessimistic. Buchanan asked him if he would be satisfied
with Austria's assurances to respect Serbia's integrity and
independence. He replied: Not if she attacked Serbia; that he would
order mobilization on the day that Austria crossed the Serbian frontier.</p>

     <p class="quote">"I told the German Ambassador [Count Pourtalès], who appealed to
     me to give moderating counsels to the Minister for Foreign
     Affairs, that from the beginning I had not ceased to do so, and
     that the German Ambassador at Vienna should now in his turn use
     his restraining influence. I made it clear to his excellency
     that, Russia being thoroughly in earnest, a general war could not
     be averted if Serbia were attacked by Austria."</p>

<p>Ambassador de Bunsen at Vienna telegraphed news of Austria's declaration
of war against Serbia, and her declination of Russia's suggestion of
direct discussion with her. Russian Ambassador Schebeko said that the
London conference now offered the only prospect of European peace, and
he was sure Russia would agree to it.</p>

     <p class="quote"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page433" name="page433"></a>(p. 433)</span> "So long as opposing armies have not actually come in
     contact, all hope need not be abandoned."</p>

<p><i>France.</i> M. Viviani, French Prime Minister, on board <i>La France</i>,
telegraphed to M. Bienvenu-Martin, Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs
at Paris, approving his course. Russia was not responsible for present
situation, and Germany could not with grace refuse to counsel Austria,
provoker of the crisis. He approved Grey's proposition of a four-power
conference.</p>

     <p class="quote">"The action of the four less interested powers cannot ... be
     exerted only at Vienna and St. Petersburg. In proposing to exert
     it also at Belgrade, which means, in fact, between Vienna and
     Belgrade, Sir E. Grey grasps the logic of the situation; and, in
     not excluding St. Petersburg, he offers, on the other hand, to
     Germany a method of withdrawing with perfect dignity from the
     <i>démarche</i> by which the German Government have caused it to be
     known at Paris and at London that the affair was looked upon by
     them as purely Austro-Serbian and without any general character."</p>

<p>M. Bienvenu-Martin replied to M. Viviani that Germany had taken no
sincere action to hold back Austria, and was opposing Grey's plan of
mediation, thus dooming it to failure. Austria will take energetic
measures to-morrow, the 29th, to compel Serbia to give them the
satisfaction demanded, and has begun to mobilize.</p>

<p>M. Paul Cambon, Ambassador at London, reported interviews of Sir Edward
Grey, Secretary of Foreign Affairs, with Count Mensdorff,
Austro-Hungarian Ambassador, and Prince Lichnowsky, German Ambassador.
The first continued to maintain that the Serbian reply was unacceptable.
The second talked like Baron von Schoen at Paris; he desired Great
Britain to use moderating influence at St. Petersburg. Grey replied that
this would be embarrassing, as Russia had been moderate from the
beginning, especially in her pacific advice to Serbia. It was at Vienna
that action was necessary, and there Germany's help was indispensable.
News had come from St. Petersburg of the first direct conversations
between Russia and Austria, that of Prime Minister Sazonof and
Ambassador Szápáry. Secretary Grey and Under-Secretary Nicholson were
doubtful of its success, since M. Sazonof had not yet secured assent to
a revision of the Serbian note by the two cabinets.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"In any case, at a moment when the least delay might have serious
     consequences, it would be very desirable that these direct
     negotiations should <span class="pagenum"><a id="page434" name="page434"></a>(p. 434)</span> be carried on in such a way as not
     to hamper Sir E. Grey's action, and not to furnish Austria with a
     pretext for slipping out of the friendly intervention of the four
     powers.</p>

     <p>"The British Ambassador at Berlin having made a determined effort
     to obtain Herr von Jagow's adherence to Sir E. Grey's suggestion,
     the German Minister for Foreign Affairs replied that it was best
     to await the result of the conversation which had been begun
     between St. Petersburg and Vienna. Sir E. Grey has, in
     consequence, directed Sir E. Goschen to suspend his <i>démarche</i>
     for the moment. In addition, the news that Austria has just
     officially declared war against Serbia opens a new phase of the
     question."</p>
</div>

<p>M. Jules Cambon, Ambassador at Berlin, reported an interview of Herr von
Jagow with M. Broniewsky, Russian Chargé d'Affaires, in which the German
Secretary of State was hopeful that Austria-Hungary's willingness to
converse with Russia after the expiration of the ultimatum to Serbia
might discover an issue from present difficulties. M. Cambon adds that
perhaps Austria is seeking time to make her preparations.</p>

<p>Von Jagow told Cambon that he could not accept the kind of conference
proposed by Grey, and that success depended on mediation taking another
form.</p>

     <p class="quote">"I laid stress upon the danger of delay, which might bring on
     war, and asked him if he wished for war. He protested, and added
     that direct conversations between Vienna and St. Petersburg were
     in progress, and that from now on he expected a favorable
     result."</p>

<p>Von Jagow had made the same suggestion to the British and Italian
Ambassadors.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"My colleagues and I thought that this was only a question of
     form, and the British Ambassador is going to suggest to his
     Government that they should change the wording of their proposal,
     which might take the character of a diplomatic <i>démarche</i> at
     Vienna and St. Petersburg.</p>

     <p>"In consequence of the repugnance shown by Herr von Jagow to any
     démarche at Vienna, Sir Edward Grey could put him in a dilemma by
     asking him to state himself precisely how diplomatic action by
     the powers to avoid war could be brought about.</p>

     <p>"We ought to associate ourselves with every effort in favor of
     peace compatible with our engagements toward our ally; but to
     place the responsibility in the proper quarter, we must take care
     to ask Germany to state precisely what she wishes."</p>
</div>

<p>M. Paléologue, Ambassador at St. Petersburg, reported that M. Sazonof,
Russian Secretary for Foreign Affairs, had said "Austria is unwilling to
converse."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page435" name="page435"></a>(p. 435)</span> M. Dumaine, Ambassador to Vienna, reported the declaration of
Count Berchtold, Austro-Hungarian Minister for Foreign Affairs, to
British Ambassador Bunsen that discussion of the Serbian reply was
useless, war having been declared. M. Schebeko, Russian Ambassador, said
that his position from the beginning had been that the question was not
of localizing the war, but preventing it. The declaration of war made
<i>pourparlers</i> by the four powers extremely difficult. The German
formula, "Mediation between Austria and Russia," is unsuitable, since it
assumes a dispute between the two empires which does not exist.</p>


<h3>WEDNESDAY, JULY 29, 1914</h3>

<p><i>Austria-Hungary.</i> On the following day, July 29, 1914, Count Berchtold,
Minister for Foreign Affairs at Vienna, telegraphed the Ambassadors at
St. Petersburg, London, Paris, and Rome, copies of a memorandum which he
had handed Herr von Tschirscky that day in answer to the <i>démarche</i> made
by the German Ambassador, namely that the Austro-Hungarian Government
should accept the Serbian reply either as satisfactory or as a basis for
discussion. The memorandum declared that, contrary to the assumption of
Sir Edward Grey, British Secretary for Foreign Affairs, at whose
instance the proceeding was taken, the parts of the Serbian reply which
were not accepted by Austria-Hungary are the most vital in it, since
they contain the guarantees for Serbia's observance of the demands made
on her. So, too, it is an assumption that the action taken against
Serbia was directed against Russia and her influence in the Balkans.
Austria-Hungary does not charge Russia with instigating the Serbian
propaganda against the Dual Monarchy. Our feelings toward her are
entirely friendly.</p>

<p>Austria-Hungary cannot adopt the desired attitude toward the Serbian
reply since this has already been outstripped by events. Our declaration
of war was made after vainly waiting three days for Serbia to abandon
her point of view.</p>

     <p class="quote">"If the British Cabinet is prepared to use its influence on the
     Russian Government with a view to the maintenance of peace
     between the great <span class="pagenum"><a id="page436" name="page436"></a>(p. 436)</span> powers, and with a view to the
     localization of the war which has been forced upon us by many
     years of Serbian intrigues, the Imperial and Royal Government
     could only welcome this."</p>

<p>Ambassador Szécsen telegraphed from Paris that France was unmistakably
making military preparations.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"The German Ambassador, Baron von Schoen is commissioned to
     discuss these preparations with M. Viviani [French Prime
     Minister] to-day, and to point out that in these circumstances
     Germany may be compelled to take similar measures which
     necessarily could not be kept secret, and which could not fail to
     cause great public excitement when they became known. In this way
     the two countries, although they are only striving for peace,
     will be compelled to at least a partial mobilization, which would
     be dangerous.</p>

     <p>"Further, in accordance with these instructions, Baron Schoen
     will declare that Germany has a lively desire that the conflict
     between us and Serbia should remain localized, and that in this
     Germany relies on the support of France."</p>
</div>

<p>Ambassador Szögyény telegraphed from Berlin that as early as the 26th
inst. the German Government had warned Russia that mobilization by her
would cause German mobilization.</p>

     <p class="quote">"Another telegram has to-day been sent to St. Petersburg, stating
     that owing to the further progress of the Russian measures of
     mobilization Germany might be brought to mobilize."</p>

<p>Ambassador Szápáry telegraphed from St. Petersburg that M. Sazonof,
Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, was greatly excited over the
alleged disinclination of Austria-Hungary to continue exchange of ideas
with Russia, and over her mobilization, which is supposed to be more
extensive than necessary, and therefore directed against Russia.</p>

<p>I visited the minister to explain matters. I agreed that you (Count
Berchtold) had declined to discuss the wording of the Serbian reply, but
made it clear that we had no intention, if the conflict remained
localized, to annex Serbian territory or touch her sovereignty, and
would always be ready to keep in touch with St. Petersburg on
Austro-Hungarian and Russian interests.</p>

<p>M. Sazonof accepted the assurance in regard to territory, but on the
point of sovereignty said he must continue to believe that our coercion
of Serbia would result in her becoming our vassal, and that this would
upset equilibrium in the Balkans, and so <span class="pagenum"><a id="page437" name="page437"></a>(p. 437)</span> involve Russian
interests. Russia recognized our legitimate interest there, but its
assertion must be acceptable to Serbia.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"I expressed the view that this was not a Russian but a Serbian
     interest, whereupon M. Sazonof claimed that Russian interests
     were in this case Serbian interests, so that I was obliged to
     make an end of the vicious circle by going on to a new topic.</p>

     <p>"I mentioned that I had heard that there was a feeling of anxiety
     in Russia, because we had mobilized eight corps for action
     against Serbia. M. Sazonof assured me that it was not he (who
     knew nothing about this) but the Chief of the General Staff who
     had expressed this anxiety. I endeavored to convince the minister
     that any unprejudiced person could easily be persuaded that our
     southern corps could not constitute a menace for Russia.</p>

     <p>"I indicated to the minister that it would be well if his
     Imperial Master were informed of the true situation, as it was
     urgently necessary, if it was desired to maintain peace, that a
     speedy end should be put to the military competition which now
     threatened to ensue on account of false news.</p>

     <p>"The minister further informed me that a ukase would be signed
     to-day, which would give orders for a mobilization in a somewhat
     extended form. He was able, however, to assure me in the most
     official way that these troops were not intended to attack us.
     They would only stand to arms in case Russian interests in the
     Balkans should be in danger. An explanatory note would make it
     clear that this was a measure of precaution, since we, who in any
     case have the advantage of quicker mobilization, have now also
     already so great a start. In earnest words I drew M. Sazonof's
     attention to the impression which such a measure would make in
     our country. I went on to express doubt whether the explanatory
     note would be calculated to soften the impression, whereupon the
     minister again gave expression to assurances regarding the
     harmlessness (!) of this measure."</p>
</div>

<p>Count Berchtold telegraphed to Count Szögyény at Berlin that the Russian
military districts of Kiev, Odessa, Moscow, and Kazan were being
mobilized. The ambassador should notify the German Government of this,
and emphasize that if Russian mobilization were not stopped without
delay, Austria-Hungary would follow with general mobilization. The
representatives of Germany and Austria-Hungary at St. Petersburg, and,
if necessary, at Paris, will declare the same to the Government there.
We will not be diverted from our course against Serbia.</p>

<p><i>Germany.</i> Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg telegraphed to Ambassador von
Schoen at Paris to protest against the military measures France was
reported to be taking, and say that, in answer, Germany would have to
proclaim "a threatening state of war."</p>

     <p class="quote"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page438" name="page438"></a>(p. 438)</span> "While this would not mean a call for the reserves or
     mobilization, yet the tension would be aggravated. We continue to
     hope for the preservation of peace."</p>

<p>Count Pourtalès, Ambassador at St. Petersburg, had an interview with M.
Sazonof, Minister for Foreign Affairs, which he reported as follows:</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"The secretary tried to persuade me that I should urge my
     Government to participate in a quadruple conference to find means
     to induce Austria-Hungary to give up those demands which touch
     upon the sovereignty of Serbia. I could merely promise to report
     the conversation and took the position that, after Russia had
     decided upon the baneful step of mobilization, every exchange of
     ideas appeared now extremely difficult, if not impossible.
     Besides, Russia now was demanding from us in regard to
     Austria-Hungary the same which Austria-Hungary was being blamed
     for with regard to Serbia, <i>i.e.</i>, an infraction of sovereignty.
     Austria-Hungary having promised to consider the Russian interests
     by disclaiming any territorial aspiration&mdash;a great concession on
     the part of a state engaged in war&mdash;should therefore be permitted
     to attend to its affairs with Serbia alone. There would be time
     at the peace conference to return to the matter of forbearance
     toward the sovereignty of Serbia.</p>

     <p>"I added very solemnly that at this moment the entire
     Austro-Serbian affair was eclipsed by the danger of a general
     European conflagration, and I endeavored to present to the
     secretary the magnitude of this danger.</p>

     <p>"It was impossible to dissuade Sazonof from the idea that Serbia
     could not now be deserted by Russia."</p>
</div>


<h4>THE KAISER AND CZAR EXCHANGE TELEGRAMS</h4>

<p>William II received the following telegram from Nicholas II:</p>

     <p class="quote">"I am glad that you are back in Germany. In this serious moment I
     ask you earnestly to help me. An ignominious war has been
     declared against a weak country and in Russia the indignation
     which I fully share is tremendous. I fear that very soon I shall
     be unable to resist the pressure exercised upon me and that I
     shall be forced to take measures which will lead to war. To
     prevent a calamity as a European war would be, I urge you in the
     name of our old friendship to do all in your power to restrain
     your ally from going too far."</p>

<p>The Kaiser replied at 6.30 p. m.:</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"I have received your telegram and I share your desire for the
     conservation of peace. However, I cannot&mdash;as I told you in my
     first telegram&mdash;consider the action of Austria-Hungary as an
     'ignominious war.' Austria-Hungary knows from experience that the
     promises of Serbia as long as they are merely on paper are
     entirely unreliable.</p>

     <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page439" name="page439"></a>(p. 439)</span> "According to my opinion the action of Austria-Hungary
     is to be considered as an attempt to receive full guaranty that
     the promises of Serbia are effectively translated into deeds. In
     this opinion I am strengthened by the explanation of the Austrian
     Cabinet that Austria-Hungary intended no territorial gain at the
     expense of Serbia. I am therefore of opinion that it is perfectly
     possible for Russia to remain a spectator in the Austro-Serbian
     war without drawing Europe into the most terrible war it has ever
     seen. I believe that a direct understanding is possible and
     desirable between your Government and Vienna, an understanding
     which&mdash;as I have already telegraphed you&mdash;my Government endeavors
     to aid with all possible effort. Naturally military measures by
     Russia, which might be construed as a menace by Austria-Hungary,
     would accelerate a calamity which both of us desire to avoid and
     would undermine my position as mediator which&mdash;upon your appeal
     to my friendship and aid&mdash;I willingly accepted."</p>
</div>

<p>The Czar answered:</p>

     <p class="quote">"Thanks for your telegram, which is conciliatory and friendly,
     whereas the official message presented to-day by your ambassador
     to my minister was conveyed in a very different tone. I beg you
     to explain this divergency. It would be right to give over the
     Austro-Serbian problem to the Hague Tribunal. I trust in your
     wisdom and friendship."</p>

<p><i>Russia.</i> M. Broniewsky, Chargé d'Affaires at Berlin, telegraphed to M.
Sazonof, Minister for Foreign Affairs, that Herr von Jagow, German
Secretary of State, had told him no news had been received from Vienna
as to acceptance of private discussions at St. Petersburg&mdash;that it was
very difficult for him to produce any effect at Vienna, especially
openly.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"He even added, in speaking to Cambon, that were pressure brought
     to bear too obviously, Austria would hasten to face Germany with
     a <i>fait accompli</i>."</p>

     <p>Von Jagow had heard from St. Petersburg that you were more
     inclined than previously to find a compromise acceptable to all
     parties. I replied that this had been your position from the
     outset, provided the compromise were acceptable not only to
     Austria, but equally to Russia. He then said that Russian
     mobilization on the frontier, of which he had heard, would render
     an understanding with Austria difficult as she was making no
     preparations on the Russian frontier. I replied that I had
     information in my possession that Austria was mobilizing there,
     and that our mobilization was in reply to it. But our measures, I
     assured him, were not directed against Germany.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page440" name="page440"></a>(p. 440)</span> Alexander, Crown Prince of Serbia, telegraphed to Nicholas II
his gratitude for the sympathy extended to Serbia by the Czar on the
28th inst.</p>

     <p class="quote">"It fills our hearts with the belief that the future of Serbia is
     secure now that it is the object of your majesty's gracious
     solicitude. These painful moments cannot but strengthen the bonds
     of deep attachment which bind Serbia to Holy Slav Russia."</p>

<p>M. Sazonof telegraphed Ambassador Isvolsky at Paris that Germany had
decided to mobilize if Russia did not cease her military preparations.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"As we cannot comply with the wishes of Germany, we have no
     alternative but to hasten on our own military preparations and to
     assume that war is probably inevitable. Please inform the French
     Government of this, and add that we are sincerely grateful to
     them for the declaration which the French Ambassador made to me
     on their behalf, that we could count fully upon the assistance of
     our ally, France. In the existing circumstances that declaration
     is especially valuable to us.</p>

     <p>"[Communicated to the Russian Ambassadors in Great Britain,
     Austria-Hungary, Italy, and Germany.]"</p>
</div>

<p><i>Great Britain.</i> Count Benckendorff, Russian Ambassador at London,
reported to Sir Edward Grey, Secretary for Foreign Affairs, that Russia
would mobilize at Odessa, Kiev, Moscow, and Kazan. This information had
been officially sent by Russia to Berlin on the 28th inst., with
assurances that there was no aggressive intention against Germany. The
Russian Ambassador, M. Schebeko, was still retained at Vienna. Direct
communication between Austria and Russia was, however, at an end, owing
to Austria's declaration of war on Serbia. Mediation by London Cabinet
to end Austria's military operations was therefore most urgent. If these
continued Austria would crush Serbia while the conference was
continuing.</p>

<p>Sir Edward Goschen, Ambassador at Berlin, telegraphed to Grey a report
of his interview with Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg.</p>

<p>He informed me that Austria-Hungary refused to act on your suggestion to
make the Serbian reply the basis of discussion. Von Jagow had written to
Vienna that, though Serbia had shown a certain desire to meet the
demands made on her, nevertheless <span class="pagenum"><a id="page441" name="page441"></a>(p. 441)</span> he appreciated Austria's
requirement of guaranties which were absent in the Serbian reply:</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"The Chancellor then went on to say that the hostilities which
     were about to be undertaken against Serbia had presumably the
     exclusive object of securing such guaranties, seeing that the
     Austrian Government already assured the Russian Government that
     they had no territorial designs.</p>

     <p>"He advised the Austro-Hungarian Government, should this view be
     correct, to speak openly in this sense. The holding of such
     language would, he hoped, eliminate all possible
     misunderstandings.</p>

     <p>"As yet, he told me, he had not received a reply from Vienna.</p>

     <p>"From the fact that he had gone so far in the matter of giving
     advice at Vienna, his excellency hoped that you would realize
     that he was sincerely doing all in his power to prevent danger of
     European complications."</p>
</div>

<p>Goschen reported an interview with the German Secretary of State. Von
Jagow was much depressed.</p>

     <p class="quote">"He reminded me that he had told me the other day that he had to
     be very careful in giving advice to Austria, as any idea that
     they were being pressed would be likely to cause them to
     precipitate matters and present a <i>fait accompli</i>. This had, in
     fact, now happened, and he was not sure that his communication of
     your suggestion that Serbia's reply offered a basis for
     discussion had not hastened declaration of war. He was much
     troubled by reports of mobilization in Russia, and of certain
     military measures, which he did not specify, being taken in
     France. He subsequently spoke of these measures to my French
     colleague [M. Jules Cambon] who informed him that French
     Government had done nothing more than the German Government had
     done, namely, recalled officers on leave. His excellency denied
     German Government had done this, but as a matter of fact it is
     true. My French colleague said to under-Secretary of State [Herr
     von Zimmermann] that, when Austria had entered Serbia, and so
     satisfied her military prestige, the moment might then be
     favorable for four disinterested powers to discuss situation and
     come forward with suggestions for preventing graver
     complications. Under-Secretary of State seemed to think idea
     worthy of consideration, as he replied that would be a different
     matter from conference proposed by you."</p>

<p>Grey replied to Goschen, stating his appreciation of the Dr. von
Bethmann-Hollweg's language, and assuring the Chancellor that Great
Britain would strain every effort for peace.</p>

     <p class="quote">"If he can induce Austria to satisfy Russia and to abstain from
     going so far as to come into collision with her, we shall all
     join in deep gratitude to his excellency for having saved the
     peace of Europe."</p>

<p>Ambassador Buchanan at St. Petersburg telegraphed to Grey that partial
mobilization had been ordered. This said M. Sazonof, Minister for
Foreign Affairs, was against Austria-Hungary <span class="pagenum"><a id="page442" name="page442"></a>(p. 442)</span> alone. Direct
conversation with St. Petersburg having been refused by Vienna, he would
urge Germany that a return be made to your proposal of a four-power
conference.</p>

<p>Ambassador Bunsen reported from Vienna that there was no step to be
taken at present to stop war with Serbia, to which the Austro-Hungarian
Government was fully committed by the declaration of war, and Kaiser
Francis Joseph's appeal to his people, published this morning. In the
opinion of Duke d'Avarans, the Italian Ambassador, Russia might be
quieted by Austria-Hungary making a binding engagement not to destroy
Serbian independence nor seize Serbian territory, but this she would
refuse to do.</p>

<p>Sir Rennell Rodd, Ambassador at Rome, telegraphed that the Marquis di
San Giuliano would urge in Berlin an exchange of views by the powers in
London, and suggest that the German Secretary of State propose a formula
acceptable to his Government.</p>

     <p class="quote">"The Secretary for Foreign Affairs remarked that it was difficult
     to make Germany believe that Russia was in earnest. As Germany,
     however, was really anxious for good relations with ourselves, if
     she believed that Great Britain would act with Russia and France
     he thought it would have a great effect."</p>

<p>Grey replied to Rodd that the London conference was now impracticable
owing to the attitude of Austria-Hungary, and that Italy must now speak
at Berlin and Vienna.</p>

<p>Grey telegraphed to Ambassador Goschen at Berlin that the German
Chancellor, Von Bethmann-Hollweg, said he was endeavoring to make
Austria satisfactorily explain at St. Petersburg the scope of her
proceedings in Serbia, but information comes from Vienna that Austria
declines to discuss the Serbian issue. Germany opposes the four-power
conference. I asked her to present her plan to prevent war between
Russia and Austria, France and Italy joined with my request.</p>

     <p class="quote">"Let mediation come into operation by any method that Germany
     thinks possible if only Germany will 'press the button' in the
     interests of peace."</p>

<p>Goschen telegraphed back to Grey that he had had an interview with
Bethmann-Hollweg who had just returned from <span class="pagenum"><a id="page443" name="page443"></a>(p. 443)</span> Potsdam. The
Chancellor feared Germany's being drawn into war by Russia attacking her
ally.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"He then proceeded to make the following strong bid for British
     neutrality. He said that it was clear, so far as he was able to
     judge the main principle which governed British policy, that
     Great Britain would never stand by and allow France to be crushed
     in any conflict there might be. That, however, was not the object
     at which Germany aimed. Provided that neutrality of Great Britain
     were certain, every assurance would be given to the British
     Government that the Imperial Government aimed at no territorial
     acquisitions at the expense of France should they prove
     victorious in any war that might ensue.</p>

     <p>"I questioned his excellency about the French colonies, and he
     said that he was unable to give a similar undertaking in that
     respect. As regards Holland, however, his excellency said that,
     so long as Germany's adversaries respected the integrity and
     neutrality of the Netherlands, Germany was ready to give his
     majesty's Government an assurance that she would do likewise. It
     depended upon the action of France what operations Germany might
     be forced to enter upon in Belgium, but when the war was over,
     Belgian integrity would be respected if she had not sided against
     Germany.</p>

     <p>"His excellency ended by saying that ever since he had been
     Chancellor the object of his policy had been, as you were aware,
     to bring about an understanding with England; he trusted that
     these assurances might form the basis of that understanding which
     he so much desired. He had in mind a general neutrality agreement
     between England and Germany, though it was of course at the
     present moment too early to discuss details, and an assurance of
     British neutrality in the conflict which present crisis might
     possibly produce, would enable him to look forward to realization
     of his desire.</p>

     <p>"In reply to his excellency's inquiry how I thought his request
     would appeal to you, I said that I did not think it probable that
     at this stage of events you would care to bind yourself to any
     course of action and that I was of opinion that you would desire
     to retain full liberty."</p>
</div>

<p>Grey informed Ambassador Bertie at Paris of a conversation he had had
with M. Paul Cambon, the French Ambassador.</p>

<p>I told Cambon that I would inform the German Ambassador Prince
Lichnowsky, to-day that he must not suppose by my friendly tone that we
should stand aside in event of a general war following failure of
efforts to maintain peace. However, I warned Cambon that the case of
Serbia was not like that of Morocco, in which we had made a special
agreement with France, but one in which we did not feel called to take a
hand.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"M. Cambon said that I had explained the situation very clearly.
     He understood it to be that in a Balkan quarrel, and in a
     struggle for supremacy between Teuton and Slav we should not feel
     called to intervene; should other <span class="pagenum"><a id="page444" name="page444"></a>(p. 444)</span> issues be raised, and
     Germany and France become involved, so that the question became
     one of the hegemony of Europe, we should then decide what it was
     necessary for us to do. He seemed quite prepared for this
     announcement, and made no criticism upon it.</p>

     <p>"He said French opinion was calm, but decided. He anticipated a
     demand from Germany that France would be neutral while Germany
     attacked Russia. This assurance France, of course, could not
     give; she was bound to help Russia if Russia was attacked."</p>
</div>

<p>Grey telegraphed Ambassador Goschen at Berlin of his conversation with
Prince Lichnowsky, in which he had pointed out</p>

     <p class="quote">"that the Russian Government, while desirous of mediation,
     regarded it as a condition that the military operations against
     Serbia should be suspended, as otherwise a mediation would only
     drag on matters, and give Austria time to crush Serbia. It was,
     of course, too late for all military operations against Serbia to
     be suspended. In a short time, I supposed, the Austrian forces
     would be in Belgrade, and in occupation of some Serbian
     territory. But even then it might be possible to bring some
     mediation into existence, if Austria, while saying that she must
     hold the occupied territory until she had complete satisfaction
     from Serbia, stated that she would not advance further, pending
     an effort of the powers to mediate between her and Russia."</p>

<p>In a following message Grey related to Goschen a second conversation
with Prince Lichnowsky, in which he told the German Ambassador that, in
event of a general war, the issues might be so great that it would
involve all European interests, and he should not think that Great
Britain would stand aside.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"He said that he quite understood this, but he asked whether I
     meant that we should, under certain circumstances, intervene?</p>

     <p>"I replied that I did not wish to say that, or to use anything
     that was like a threat or an attempt to apply pressure by saying
     that, if things became worse, we should intervene. There would be
     no question of our intervening if Germany was not involved, or
     even if France was not involved. But we knew very well, that if
     the issue did become such that we thought British interests
     required us to intervene, we must intervene at once, and the
     decision would have to be very rapid, just as the decisions of
     other powers had to be....</p>

     <p>"The German Ambassador took no exception to what I had said;
     indeed, he told me that it accorded with what he had already
     given in Berlin as his view of the situation."</p>
</div>

<p>In still another message Grey informed Goschen that he had said to the
German Ambassador, in reference to the suggestion of San Giuliano, the
Italian Prime Minister of mediation between Russia and Austria, that it
would not be mediation to urge <span class="pagenum"><a id="page445" name="page445"></a>(p. 445)</span> Russia to stand aside and give
Austria a free hand to go any length she pleased.</p>

<p>Grey informed Ambassador Bunsen at Vienna that Austro-Hungarian
Ambassador Mensdorff, had offered to submit him a long memorandum
justifying the action of his government toward Serbia. Grey refused to
discuss the Serbian question now that the peace of Europe was
imperilled. The greater question settled, the powers might be free to
obtain satisfaction for Austria in the lesser.</p>

     <p class="quote">"In reply to some further remarks of mine, as to the effect that
     the Austrian action might have upon the Russian position in the
     Balkans, he said that, before the Balkan war, Serbia had always
     been regarded as being in the Austrian sphere of influence."</p>

<p>Bunsen reported to Grey that the news of Russian mobilization was not
generally known in Vienna.</p>

<p><i>France.</i> M. Bienvenu-Martin, Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs,
notified the Ambassadors at St. Petersburg, London, Berlin, Rome,
Vienna, and Constantinople, and the Minister to Serbia, that the
Austro-German attitude was becoming clearer.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"Austria, uneasy concerning the Slav propaganda, has seized the
     opportunity of the crime of Sarajevo in order to punish the
     Serbian intrigues, and to obtain in this quarter guaranties
     which, according as events are allowed to develop or not, will
     either affect only the Serbian Government and army, or become
     territorial questions. Germany intervenes between her ally and
     the other powers and declares that the question is a local one,
     namely, punishment of a political crime committed in the past,
     and sure guaranties for the future that the anti-Austrian
     intrigues will be put an end to. The German Government thinks
     that Russia should be content with the official and formal
     assurances given by Austria that she does not seek territorial
     aggrandizement and that she will respect the integrity of Serbia;
     in these circumstances the danger of war can come only from
     Russia, if she seeks to intervene in a question which is well
     defined. In these circumstances any action for the maintenance of
     peace must take place at St. Petersburg alone.</p>

     <p>"The attitude at Berlin, as at Vienna, is still dilatory. In the
     former capital, while protesting that the Germans desire to
     safeguard general peace by common action between the four powers,
     the idea of a conference is rejected without any other expedient
     being suggested, and while they refuse to take any positive
     action at Vienna. In the Austrian capital they would like to keep
     St. Petersburg in play with the illusion of an <i>entente</i> which
     might result from direct conversations, while they are taking
     action against Serbia.</p>

     <p>"In these circumstances it seems essential that the St.
     Petersburg Cabinet, whose desire to unravel this crisis
     peacefully is manifest, should <span class="pagenum"><a id="page446" name="page446"></a>(p. 446)</span> immediately give their
     adherence to the British proposal. This proposal must be strongly
     supported at Berlin in order to decide [Secretary of State] Von
     Jagow to take real action at Vienna capable of stopping Austria
     and preventing her from supplementing her diplomatic advantage by
     military successes. The Austro-Hungarian Government would,
     indeed, not be slow to take advantage of it in order to impose on
     Serbia, under the elastic expression of 'guaranties' conditions
     which, in spite of all assurances that no territorial
     aggrandizement was being sought, would in effect modify the
     status of eastern Europe, and would run the risk of gravely
     compromising the general peace either at once or in the near
     future."</p>

<p>Vittorio Emanuele III, King of Italy.</p></div>

<p>Ambassador Paléologue telegraphed from St. Petersburg that Russia would
acquiesce in any measures proposed by France and Great Britain to
maintain peace. Minister Klobukowski reported from Brussels that the
Belgian Government regarded Germany's attitude as enigmatical, and
justifying every apprehension.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"It seems improbable that the Austro-Hungarian Government would
     have taken an initiative which would lead, according to a
     preconceived plan, to a declaration of war, without previous
     arrangement with the Emperor William.</p>

     <p>"The German Government stand 'with rounded arms' ready to take
     peaceful or warlike action as circumstances may require; a sudden
     intervention against us would not surprise anybody here.</p>

     <p>"The Belgian Government are taking steps which harmonize with the
     statement made to me yesterday by M. Davignon that everything
     will be put in readiness for the defence of the neutrality of the
     country."</p>
</div>

<p>Ambassador Dumaine reported from Vienna:</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"The French Consul at Prague confirms the mobilization of the
     Eighth Army corps, and that of the Landwehr division of this army
     corps. The cavalry divisions in Galicia are also mobilizing;
     regiments and cavalry divisions from Vienna and Budapest have
     already been transported to the Russian frontier. Reservists are
     now being called together in this district.</p>

     <p>"There is a rumor that the Austro-Hungarian Government, in order
     to be in a position to meet any danger, and perhaps in order to
     impress St. Petersburg, intend to decide on a general
     mobilization of their forces on July 30, or August 1. The
     Austrian Emperor will return from Ischl to Vienna to-morrow."</p>
</div>

<p>Ambassador Paléologue reported from Berlin that Austria-Hungary refused
direct conversation offered by Russia.</p>


     <p class="quote">"Austria is hurrying on her military preparations against Russia,
     and is pressing forward the mobilization which has begun on the
     Galician frontier. As a result the order to mobilize will be
     dispatched to-night to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page447" name="page447"></a>(p. 447)</span> thirteen army corps, which are
     destined to operate eventually against Austria."</p>

<p>Ambassador Jules Cambon reported from Berlin his interview with the
German Secretary of State. Von Jagow was awaiting reply from Vienna to
his request to hold direct conversation with Russia. He considered that
the Serbian reply afforded a basis for negotiation.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"I said that it was just on that account that I considered the
     rupture by Austria, after she had received such a document,
     inexplicable.</p>

     <p>"The Secretary of State then remarked that with eastern nations
     one could never obtain sufficient guaranties, and that Austria
     wished to be able to supervise the carrying out of promises made
     to her, a supervision which Serbia refused. This, in the eyes of
     the Secretary of State, is the cardinal point. I answered Herr
     von Jagow that Serbia, as she wished to remain independent, was
     bound to reject the control of a single power, but that an
     International Commission would not have the same character. The
     Balkan States have more than one, for instance the Financial
     Commission at Athens. One could imagine among other combinations,
     a Provisional International Commission, charged with the duty of
     controlling the police inquiry demanded by Austria; it was clear,
     by this instance, that the reply of Serbia opened the door to
     conversations and did not justify a rupture.</p>

     <p>"I then asked the Secretary of State if, leaving aside direct
     conversations between Vienna and St. Petersburg to which Sir E.
     Grey had given his adherence, he did not think that common action
     could be exercised by the four powers by means of their
     ambassadors. He answered in the affirmative, adding that at this
     moment the London Cabinet were confining themselves to exercising
     their influence in support of direct conversations."</p>
</div>

<p>He gave a summary of the interview between Bethmann-Hollweg and British
Ambassador Goschen.</p>

     <p class="quote">"The attitude of the German Chancellor is very probably the
     result of the last interview of Sir E. Grey with Ambassador
     Lichnowsky. Up to quite the last days they flattered themselves
     here that England would remain out of the question, and the
     impression produced on the German Government and on the
     financiers and business men by her attitude is profound."</p>

<p>Ambassador Dumaine reported from Vienna that he and his British,
Russian, and Italian colleagues agreed that war is now certain between
Austria and Serbia since all attempts to avoid it have failed. The
Italian Ambassador, Duke d'Avarna, said</p>

     <p class="quote">"it is very probable that the imminence of a general insurrection
     among the Southern Slav inhabitants precipitated the resolutions
     of the [Dual] Monarchy. He still clings to the hope that, after a
     first success of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page448" name="page448"></a>(p. 448)</span> Austro-Hungarian arms, but not
     before this, mediation might be able to limit the conflict."</p>

<p>M. Bienvenu-Martin, Acting Secretary of Foreign Affairs, informed the
ambassadors at London, Berlin, St. Petersburg, Rome, Vienna, and
Constantinople, and the minister to Serbia, of a semiofficial
communication made by the German Ambassador.</p>

<p>Germany, said Baron von Schoen, was continuing its efforts to induce
Austria-Hungary to hold direct conversations with Russia, being in no
way impeded by her ally's declaration of war on Serbia. Germany did not
know Austria's intentions.</p>

<p>A second message was sent to these French representatives abroad
reporting an interview of M. Bienvenu-Martin and the Russian Ambassador
at Paris.</p>

<p>M. Isvolsky communicated the telegram from Sazonof, Russian Minister for
Foreign Affairs to Berlin, notifying Germany of Russian mobilization in
the southern provinces, and the telegrams from Sazonof to London asking
Great Britain to use her influence as quickly as possible with Austria
to secure cessation of military operations, and stating that he believed
Germany was favoring her ally's uncompromising attitude.</p>

<p>Ambassador Barrère at Rome reported that the Italian Minister for
Foreign Affairs had been officially informed of the above telegrams.</p>

<p>M. Viviani, who had now reached Paris and resumed his office of Minister
for Foreign Affairs, instructed Ambassador Paul Cambon at London to
request Sir Edward Grey to renew at Berlin his proposal of four-power
mediation, the principle of which had been accepted by both Germany and
Russia.</p>

     <p class="quote">"I would ask you also to point out to the British Secretary of
     State how important it would be for him to obtain from the
     Italian Government the most whole-hearted continuance of their
     support in cooperating in the action of the four powers in favor
     of peace."</p>

<p>M. Paul Cambon reported that Grey had invited Germany to propose her own
formula for peace as acceptable to Great Britain, France, and Italy.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said to me that
     Germany's reply to this communication and to that of Russia
     concerning the mobilization <span class="pagenum"><a id="page449" name="page449"></a>(p. 449)</span> of four army corps on the
     Austrian frontier would allow us to realize the intentions of the
     German Government.</p>

     <p>"Sir E. Grey did not disguise the fact that he found the
     situation very grave and that he had little hope of a peaceful
     solution."</p>
</div>

<p>Ambassador Paléologue telegraphed from St. Petersburg of the
notification by the German Ambassador that Russia must stop mobilization
or Germany would mobilize.</p>

     <p class="quote">"The tone in which Count Pourtalès delivered this communication
     has decided the Russian Government this very night to order the
     mobilization of the thirteen army corps which are to operate
     against Austria."</p>

<p><i>Belgium.</i> M. Davignon, Minister for Foreign Affairs, notified the
ministers at Berlin, Vienna, Paris, London, St. Petersburg, Rome, The
Hague, and Luxemburg that the Belgian Government had decided to place
the army upon a strengthened peace footing.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"This step should in no way be confused with mobilization.</p>

     <p>"Owing to the small extent of her territory, all Belgium
     consists, in some degree, of a frontier zone. Her army on the
     ordinary peace footing consists of only one class of armed
     militia; on the strengthened peace footing, owing to the recall
     of three classes, her army divisions and her cavalry division
     comprise effective units of the same strength as those of the
     corps permanently maintained in the frontier zones of the
     neighboring powers."</p>
</div>


<h3>THURSDAY, JULY 30, 1914</h3>

<p><i>Austria-Hungary.</i> On the following day Count Berchtold, Minister for
Foreign Affairs, telegraphed to Count Szápáry at St. Petersburg his
answer to the ambassador's telegram of July 29:</p>

     <p class="quote">"I am of course still ready to explain to M. Sazonof [Russian
     Minister for Foreign Affairs] the various points contained in our
     note addressed to Serbia which, however, has already been
     outstripped by recent events. I should also attach special
     importance, in accordance with the suggestion made to me through
     M. Schebeko [Russian Ambassador at Vienna], also, to discussing
     on this occasion in a confidential and friendly manner the
     questions which affect directly our relations toward Russia. From
     this it might be hoped that it would be possible to remove the
     ambiguities which have arisen and to secure the development in a
     friendly manner of our relations toward our neighbors, which is
     so desirable an object."</p>

<p>This was followed by another telegram. Count Berchtold said that he had
explained to Russian Ambassador Schebeko what seemed his flat refusal to
discuss matters directly with Russia, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page450" name="page450"></a>(p. 450)</span> which had so hurt the
feelings of the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"This must rest on a misunderstanding, as M. Schebeko and myself
     had discussed the practical questions two days before, a fact
     which the ambassador confirmed with the observation that he had
     fully informed M. Sazonof of this conversation.</p>

     <p>"M. Schebeko then explained why our action against Serbia was
     regarded with such anxiety at St. Petersburg. He said that we
     were a great power which was proceeding against the small Serbian
     state, and it was not known at St. Petersburg what our intentions
     in the matter were; whether we desired to encroach on its
     sovereignty, whether we desired completely to overthrow it, or
     even to crush it to the ground. Russia could not be indifferent
     toward the future fate of Serbia, which was linked to Russia by
     historical and other bonds. At St. Petersburg they had taken the
     trouble to use all their influence at Belgrade to induce them to
     accept all our conditions, though this was indeed at a time when
     the conditions afterward imposed by us could not yet be known.
     But even with reference to these demands they would do everything
     they could in order to accomplish at any rate all that was
     possible.</p>

     <p>"I reminded the ambassador that we had repeatedly emphasized the
     fact that we did not desire to follow any policy of conquest in
     Serbia, also that we would not infringe her sovereignty, but we
     only desired to establish a condition of affairs which would
     offer us a guarantee against being disturbed by Serbia. To this I
     added a somewhat lengthy discussion of our intolerable relations
     with Serbia. I also gave M. Schebeko clearly to understand to how
     large an extent Russian diplomacy was responsible for these
     circumstances, even though this result might be contrary to the
     wishes of the responsible authorities.</p>

     <p>"I referred to the Russian mobilization which had then come to my
     knowledge. Since this was limited to the military districts of
     Odessa, Kiev, Moscow, and Kazan it had an appearance of hostility
     against the [Dual] Monarchy. I did not know what the grounds for
     this might be, as there was no dispute between us and Russia.
     Austria-Hungary had mobilized exclusively against Serbia; against
     Russia not a single man; and this would be observed from the
     single fact that the first, tenth, and eleventh corps had not
     been mobilized. In view, however, of the fact that Russia was
     openly mobilizing against us, we should have to extend our
     mobilization too, and in this case I desired to mention expressly
     that this measure did not, of course, imply any attitude of
     hostility toward Russia."</p>
</div>

<p><i>Germany.</i> Military Attaché Eggeling at St. Petersburg telegraphed to
William II that Prince Troubetzki had said to him yesterday: "Thank God
that a telegram from your emperor has come!"</p>

     <p class="quote">"He has just told me the telegram has made a deep impression upon
     the czar but as the mobilization against Austria had already been
     ordered and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page451" name="page451"></a>(p. 451)</span> Sazonof [Minister for Foreign Affairs] had
     convinced his majesty that it was no longer possible to retreat,
     his majesty was sorry he could not change it any more. I then
     told him that the guilt for the measureless consequences lay at
     the door of premature mobilization against Austria-Hungary which
     after all was involved merely in a local war with Serbia, for
     Germany's answer was clear and the responsibility rested upon
     Russia which ignored Austria-Hungary's assurance that it had no
     intentions of territorial gain in Serbia. Austria-Hungary
     mobilized against Serbia and not against Russia and there was no
     ground for an immediate action on the part of Russia. I further
     added that in Germany one could not understand any more Russia's
     phrase that 'she could not desert her brethren in Serbia' after
     the horrible crime of Sarajevo. I told him finally he need not
     wonder if Germany's army were to be mobilized."</p>

<p>At 1 a. m. the German Kaiser telegraphed to Nicholas II:</p>

     <p class="quote">"My ambassador has instructions to direct the attention of your
     Government to the dangers and serious consequences of a
     mobilization. I have told you the same in my last telegram.
     Austria-Hungary has mobilized only against Serbia, and only a
     part of her army. If Russia, as seems to be the case, according
     to your advice and that of your Government, mobilizes against
     Austria-Hungary, the part of the mediator with which you have
     intrusted me in such friendly manner and which I have accepted
     upon your express desire, is threatened if not made impossible.
     The entire weight of decision now rests upon your shoulders, you
     have to bear the responsibility for war or peace."</p>


<h4>HENRY OF PRUSSIA AND GEORGE V</h4>

<p>The Czar at once replied:</p>

     <p class="quote">"I thank you from my heart for your quick reply. I am sending
     to-night Tatisheff (Russian honorary aide to the Kaiser) with
     instructions. The military measures now taking form were decided
     upon five days ago, and for the reason of defense against the
     preparations of Austria. I hope with all my heart that these
     measures will not influence in any manner your position as
     mediator, which I appraise very highly. We need your strong
     pressure upon Austria so that an understanding can be arrived at
     with us."</p>

<p>Prince Henry of Prussia, brother of the Kaiser, telegraphed to the King
of Great Britain from Berlin:</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"I arrived here yesterday and have communicated what you were so
     good as to say to me at Buckingham Palace last Sunday to William,
     who was very thankful to receive your message.</p>

     <p>"William, who is very anxious, is doing his utmost to comply with
     the request of Nicholas to work for the maintenance of peace. He
     is in continual telegraphic communication with Nicholas, who has
     to-day confirmed the news that he has ordered military measures
     which amount to mobilization, and that these measures were taken
     five days ago.</p>

     <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page452" name="page452"></a>(p. 452)</span> "We have also received information that France is making
     military preparations while we have not taken measures of any
     kind, but may be obliged to do so at any moment if our neighbors
     continue their preparations. This would then mean a European war.</p>

     <p>"If you seriously and earnestly desire to prevent this terrible
     misfortune, may I propose to you to use your influence on France
     and also on Russia that they should remain neutral. In my view
     this would be of the greatest use. I consider that this is a
     certain and, perhaps, the only possible way of maintaining the
     peace of Europe. I might add that Germany and England should now
     more than ever give each other mutual support in order to prevent
     a terrible disaster, which otherwise appears inevitable.</p>

     <p>"Believe me that William is inspired by the greatest sincerity in
     his efforts for the maintenance of peace. But the military
     preparations of his two neighbors may end in compelling him to
     follow their example for the safety of his own country, which
     otherwise would remain defenseless."</p>
</div>

<p>George V replied:</p>

     <p class="quote">"I am very glad to hear of William's efforts to act with Nicholas
     for the maintenance of peace. I earnestly desire that such a
     misfortune as a European war&mdash;the evil of which could not be
     remedied&mdash;may be prevented. My Government is doing the utmost
     possible in order to induce Russia and France to postpone further
     military preparations, provided that Austria declares herself
     satisfied with the occupation of Belgrade and the neighboring
     Serbian territory as a pledge for a satisfactory settlement of
     her demands, while at the same time the other countries suspend
     their preparations for war. I rely on William applying his great
     influence in order to induce Austria to accept this proposal. In
     this way he will prove that Germany and England are working
     together to prevent what would be an international catastrophe.
     Please assure William that I am doing all I can, and will
     continue to do all that lies in my power, to maintain the peace
     of Europe."</p>

<p><i>Russia.</i> M. Strandtman, Chargé d'Affaires in Serbia, telegraphed from
Nish to M. Sazonof, Minister for Foreign Affairs at St. Petersburg, that
Prince Regent Alexander had yesterday published a manifesto, signed by
all the Serbian Ministers, on Austria's declaration of war against
Serbia.</p>

<p>M. Sazonof telegraphed to the ambassadors at Berlin, Vienna, Paris,
London, and Rome:</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"The German Ambassador [Count Pourtalès], who has just left me,
     has asked whether Russia would not be satisfied with the promise
     which Austria might give&mdash;that she would not violate the
     integrity of the Kingdom of Serbia&mdash;and whether we could not
     indicate upon what conditions we would agree to suspend our
     military preparations. I dictated to him the following
     declaration to be forwarded to Berlin for immediate action:</p>

     <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page453" name="page453"></a>(p. 453)</span> "'If Austria, recognizing that the Austro-Serbian
     question has assumed the character of a question of European
     interest, declares herself ready to eliminate from her ultimatum
     points which violate the sovereign rights of Serbia, Russia
     engages to stop her military preparations.'</p>

     <p>"Please inform me at once by telegraph what attitude the German
     Government will adopt in face of this fresh proof of our desire
     to do the utmost possible for a peaceful settlement of the
     question, for we cannot allow such discussions to continue solely
     in order that Germany and Austria may gain time for their
     military preparations."</p>
</div>

<p>Ambassador Swerbeiev telegraphed from Berlin that the order for the
mobilization of the German army and navy had just been issued. He
followed this with a telegram stating that Secretary of State von Jagow
had just telephoned him that the news was false:</p>

     <p class="quote">"the news sheets had been printed in advance so as to be ready
     for all eventualities, and they were put on sale in the
     afternoon, but they have now been confiscated."</p>

<p>Ambassador Swerbeiev telegraphed from Berlin to M. Sazonof that he had
presented the minister's telegram of July 29 to Secretary of State von
Jagow, who "declared that he considered it impossible for Austria to
accept our proposal."</p>

<p><i>Great Britain.</i> Ambassador Bunsen telegraphed from Vienna to Sir Edward
Grey, Secretary for Foreign Affairs:</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"Russian Ambassador [Schebeko] hopes that Russian mobilization
     will be regarded by Austria as what it is, viz., a clear
     intimation that Russia must be consulted regarding the fate of
     Serbia, but he does not know how the Austrian Government are
     taking it. He says that Russia must have an assurance that Serbia
     will not be crushed, but she would understand that
     Austria-Hungary is compelled to exact from Serbia measures which
     will secure her Slav provinces from the continuance of hostile
     propaganda from Serbian territory.</p>

     <p>"The French Ambassador [Dumaine] hears from Berlin that the
     German Ambassador at Vienna [Tschirsky] is instructed to speak
     seriously to the Austro-Hungarian Government against acting in a
     manner calculated to provoke a European war.</p>

     <p>"Unfortunately the German Ambassador is himself so identified
     with extreme anti-Russian and anti-Serbian feeling prevalent in
     Vienna that he is unlikely to plead the cause of peace with
     entire sincerity.</p>

     <p>"Although I am not able to verify it, I have private information
     that the German Ambassador knew the text of the Austrian
     ultimatum to Serbia before it was dispatched, and telegraphed it
     to the German Emperor. I know from the German Ambassador himself
     that he indorses every line of it."</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page454" name="page454"></a>(p. 454)</span> Ambassador Buchanan telegraphed from St. Petersburg to Grey of
an interview with the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"M. Sazonof said that German Ambassador [Count Pourtalès] had
     told him yesterday afternoon that German Government were willing
     to guarantee that Serbian integrity would be respected by
     Austria. To this he had replied that this might be so, but
     nevertheless Serbia would become an Austrian vassal, just as, in
     similar circumstances Bokhara had become a Russian vassal. There
     would be a revolution in Russia if she were to tolerate such a
     state of affairs.</p>

     <p>"M. Sazonof told us that absolute proof was in possession of
     Russian Government that Germany was making military and naval
     preparations against Russia&mdash;more particularly in the direction
     of the Gulf of Finland.</p>

     <p>"German Ambassador had a second interview with Minister for
     Foreign Affairs at 2 a. m., when former completely broke down on
     seeing that war was inevitable. He appealed to M. Sazonof to make
     some suggestion which he could telegraph to German Government as
     a last hope. M. Sazonof accordingly drew up and handed to German
     Ambassador a formula.</p>

     <p>"'If Austria, recognizing that her conflict with Serbia has
     assumed character of question of European interest, declares
     herself ready to eliminate from her ultimatum points which
     violate principle of sovereignty of Serbia, Russia engages to
     stop all military preparations.'</p>

     <p>"Preparations for general mobilization will be proceeded with if
     this proposal is rejected by Austria, and inevitable result will
     be a European war. Excitement here has reached such a pitch that,
     if Austria refuses to make a concession, Russia cannot hold back,
     and now that she knows that Germany is arming, she can hardly
     postpone, for strategical reasons, converting partial into
     general mobilization."</p>
</div>

<p>Ambassador Goschen telegraphed from Berlin to Grey:</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"Secretary of State [Von Jagow] informs me that immediately on
     receipt of Prince Lichnowsky's [German Ambassador in London]
     telegram recording his last conversation with you he asked
     Austro-Hungarian Government whether they would be willing to
     accept mediation on basis of occupation by Austrian troops of
     Belgrade or some other point and issue their conditions from
     here. He has up till now received no reply, but he fears Russian
     mobilization against Austria will have increased difficulties, as
     Austria-Hungary, who has as yet only mobilized against Serbia,
     will probably find it necessary also against Russia. Secretary of
     State says if you can succeed in getting Russia to agree to above
     basis for an arrangement and in persuading her in the meantime to
     take no steps which might be regarded as an act of aggression
     against Austria he still sees some chance that European peace may
     be preserved.</p>

     <p>"He begged me to impress on you difficulty of Germany's position
     in view of Russian mobilization and military measures which he
     hears are being taken in France. Beyond recall of officers on
     leave&mdash;a measure which had been officially taken after, and not
     before, visit of French Ambassador <span class="pagenum"><a id="page455" name="page455"></a>(p. 455)</span> [Jules Cambon]
     yesterday&mdash;Imperial Government had done nothing special in way of
     military preparations. Something, however, would have soon to be
     done, for it might be too late, and when they mobilized they
     would have to mobilize on three sides. He regretted this, as he
     knew France did not desire war, but it would be a military
     necessity.</p>

     <p>"His excellency added that telegram received from Prince
     Lichnowsky last night contains matter which he had heard with
     regret, but not exactly with surprise, and at all events he
     thoroughly appreciated frankness and loyalty with which you had
     spoken.</p>

     <p>"He also told me that this telegram had only reached Berlin very
     late last night; had it been received earlier chancellor would,
     of course, not have spoken to me in the way he had done."</p>
</div>

<p>Ambassador Bertie telegraphed from Paris to Grey the report of Germany's
request to Russia to be informed on what conditions Russia would consent
to demobilization.</p>

     <p class="quote">"The answer given is that she agrees to do so on condition that
     Austria-Hungary gives an assurance that she will respect the
     sovereignty of Serbia and submit certain of the demands of the
     Austrian note, which Serbia has not accepted, to an international
     discussion."</p>


<h4>SIR EDWARD GREY REFUSES TERMS OF NEUTRALITY</h4>

<p>Grey telegraphed to Ambassador Goschen at Berlin in answer to his
telegram of July 29:</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"His Majesty's Government cannot for a moment entertain the
     Chancellor's proposal that they should bind themselves to
     neutrality on such terms.</p>

     <p>"What he asks us in effect is to engage to stand by while French
     colonies are taken and France is beaten, so long as Germany does
     not take French territory as distinct from the colonies.</p>

     <p>"From the material point of view such a proposal is unacceptable,
     for France, without further territory in Europe being taken from
     her, could be so crushed as to lose her position as a great
     power, and become subordinate to German policy.</p>

     <p>"Altogether apart from that, it would be a disgrace for us to
     make this bargain with Germany at the expense of France, a
     disgrace from which the good name of this country would never
     recover.</p>

     <p>"The chancellor also in effect asks us to bargain away whatever
     obligation or interest we have as regards the neutrality of
     Belgium. We could not entertain that bargain either.</p>

     <p>"Having said so much it is unnecessary to examine whether the
     prospect of a future general neutrality agreement between England
     and Germany offered positive advantages sufficient to compensate
     us for tying our hands now. We must preserve our full freedom to
     act as circumstances may seem <span class="pagenum"><a id="page456" name="page456"></a>(p. 456)</span> to us to require in any
     such unfavorable and regrettable development of the present
     crisis as the chancellor contemplates.</p>

     <p>"You should speak to the chancellor in the above sense, and add
     most earnestly that the one way of maintaining the good relations
     between England and Germany is that they should continue to work
     together to preserve the peace of Europe; if we succeeded in this
     object, the mutual relations of Germany and England will, I
     believe, be <i>ipso facto</i> improved and strengthened. For that
     object his majesty's Government will work in that way with all
     sincerity and good will.</p>

     <p>"And I will say this: If the peace of Europe can be preserved,
     and the present crisis safely passed, my own endeavor will be to
     promote some arrangement to which Germany could be a party, by
     which she could be assured that no aggressive or hostile policy
     would be pursued against her or her Allies by France, Russia, and
     ourselves, jointly or separately. I have desired this and worked
     for it, as far as I could, through the last Balkan crisis, and,
     Germany having a corresponding object, our relations sensibly
     improved. The idea has hitherto been too Utopian to form the
     subject of definite proposals, but if this present crisis, so
     much more acute than any that Europe has gone through for
     generations, be safely passed, I am hopeful that the relief and
     reaction which will follow may make possible some more definite
     rapprochement between the powers than has been possible
     hitherto."</p>
</div>

<p>Grey telegraphed Ambassador Buchanan at St. Petersburg:</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"German Ambassador [Prince Lichnowsky] informs me that German
     Government would endeavor to influence Austria, after taking
     Belgrade and Serbian territory in region of frontier, to promise
     not to advance further, while powers endeavored to arrange that
     Serbia should give satisfaction sufficient to pacify Austria.
     Territory occupied would of course be evacuated when Austria was
     satisfied. I suggested this yesterday as a possible relief to the
     situation, and, if it can be obtained, I would earnestly hope
     that it might be agreed to suspend further military preparations
     on all sides.</p>

     <p>"Russian Ambassador [Count Benckendorff] has told me of condition
     laid down by M. Sazonof [Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs],
     as quoted in your telegram of July 30, and fears it cannot be
     modified; but if Austrian advance were stopped after occupation
     of Belgrade, I think Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs'
     formula might be changed to read that the powers would examine
     how Serbia could fully satisfy Austria without impairing Serbian
     sovereign rights or independence.</p>

     <p>"If Austria, having occupied Belgrade and neighboring Serbian
     territory declares herself ready, in the interest of European
     peace, to cease her advance and to discuss how a complete
     settlement can be arrived at, I hope that Russia would also
     consent to discussion and suspension of further military
     preparations, provided that other powers did the same.</p>

     <p>"It is a slender chance of preserving peace, but the only one I
     can suggest if Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs can come to
     no agreement at Berlin. You should inform Minister for Foreign
     Affairs"</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page457" name="page457"></a>(p. 457)</span> Grey wrote Ambassador Bertie at Paris enclosing a copy of a
letter he had written to Paul Cambon, French Ambassador at London, on
November 22, 1912, and of the agreement of which M. Cambon had just
reminded him. The letter was as follows:</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"From time to time in recent years the French and British naval
     and military experts have consulted together. It has always been
     understood that such consultation does not restrict the freedom
     of either Government to decide at any future time whether or not
     to assist the other by armed force. We have agreed that
     consultation between experts is not, and ought not to be regarded
     as, an engagement that commits either Government to action in a
     contingency that has not arisen and may never arise. The
     disposition, for instance, of the French and British fleets
     respectively at the present moment is not based upon an
     engagement to cooperate in war.</p>

     <p>"You have, however, pointed out that, if either Government had
     grave reason to expect an unprovoked attack by a third power, it
     might become essential to know whether it could in that event
     depend upon the armed assistance of the other.</p>

     <p>"I agree that, if either Government had grave reason to expect an
     unprovoked attack by a third power, or something that threatened
     the general peace, it should immediately discuss with the other
     whether both Governments should act together to prevent
     aggression and to preserve peace, and, if so, what measures they
     would be prepared to take in common. If these measures involved
     action, the plans of the General Staffs would at once be taken
     into consideration, and the Governments would then decide what
     effect should be given to them."</p>
</div>

<p>Ambassador Goschen telegraphed from Berlin to Sir Edward Grey:</p>

     <p class="quote">"The Chancellor [Dr. von Bethmann-Hollweg] told me last night
     that he was 'pressing the button' as hard as he could, and that
     he was not sure whether he had not gone so far in urging
     moderation at Vienna that matters had been precipitated rather
     than otherwise."</p>

<p><i>France.</i> M. Viviani, Prime Minister, informed the Ambassadors at St.
Petersburg and London that Germany had notified Russia of her decision
to mobilize unless Russia ceased her military preparations.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"M. Sazonof, Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, declares that
     in these circumstances Russia can only expedite her arming and
     consider war as imminent; that she counts on the help of France
     as an ally; and that she considers it desirable that England
     should join Russia and France without loss of time.</p>

     <p>"France is resolved to fulfill all the obligations of her
     alliance.</p>

     <p>"She will not neglect, however, any effort toward a solution of
     the conflict in the interests of universal peace. The
     conversation entered into between the powers which are less
     directly interested still allows of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page458" name="page458"></a>(p. 458)</span> hope that peace
     may be preserved; I therefore think it would be well that, in
     taking any precautionary measures of defense, which Russia thinks
     must go on, she should not immediately take any step which may
     offer to Germany a pretext for a total or partial mobilization of
     her forces.</p>

     <p>"Yesterday, in the late afternoon, the German Ambassador [Baron
     von Schoen] spoke to me of the military measures which the
     Government of the republic were taking, adding that France was
     able to act in this way, but that in Germany preparations could
     not be secret and that French opinion should not be alarmed if
     Germany decided on them.</p>

     <p>"I answered that the French Government had not taken any step
     which could give their neighbors any cause for disquietude, and
     that their wish to lend themselves to any negotiations for the
     purpose of maintaining peace could not be doubted."</p>
</div>

<p>Ambassador Paléologue reported from St. Petersburg that, in deference to
the desire of M. Viviani, no pretext be offered Germany for general
mobilization, the Russian General Staff had suspended all measures of
military precaution.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"Yesterday the chief of the staff sent for the Military Attaché
     of the German Embassy and gave him his word of honor that the
     mobilization ordered this morning was exclusively directed
     against Austria.</p>

     <p>"Nevertheless, from an interview which he had this afternoon with
     Count Pourtalès [German Ambassador], M. Sazonof was forced to the
     conclusion that Germany does not wish to pronounce at Vienna the
     decisive word which would safeguard peace. The Emperor Nicholas
     has received the same impression from an exchange of telegrams
     which he has just had personally with the Emperor William.</p>

     <p>"Moreover, the Russian General Staff and Admiralty have received
     disquieting information concerning the preparations of the German
     army and navy.</p>

     <p>"In giving me this information Mr. Sazonof added that the Russian
     Government are continuing none the less their efforts toward
     conciliation. He repeated to me: 'I shall continue to negotiate
     until the last moment.'"</p>
</div>

<p>Ambassador Jules Cambon reported from Berlin of the official recall of
the press announcement of German mobilization, but added that his
apprehension of the plans of Germany was not diminished thereby.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"It seems certain that the Extraordinary Council held yesterday
     evening at Potsdam with the military authorities under the
     presidency of the emperor decided on mobilization, and this
     explains the preparation of the special edition of the 'Lokal
     Anzeiger,' but that from various causes (the declaration of Great
     Britain that she reserved her entire liberty of action, the
     exchange of telegrams between the czar and William II) the
     serious measures which had been decided upon were suspended.</p>

     <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page459" name="page459"></a>(p. 459)</span> "One of the ambassadors with whom I have very close
     relations saw Herr von Zimmermann at two o'clock. According to
     the Under-Secretary of State, the military authorities are very
     anxious that mobilization should be ordered, because every delay
     makes Germany lose some of her advantages. Nevertheless, up to
     the present time the haste of the General Staff, which sees war
     in mobilization, had been successfully prevented. In any case
     mobilization may be decided upon at any moment. I do not know who
     has issued in the 'Lokal Anzeiger,' a paper which is usually
     semiofficial, premature news calculated to cause excitement in
     France.</p>

     <p>"Further, I have the strongest reasons to believe that all the
     measures for mobilization which can be taken before the
     publication of the general order have already been taken here,
     and that they are anxious here to make us publish our
     mobilization first in order to attribute the responsibility to
     us."</p>
</div>

<p>M. Viviani instructed Ambassador Paul Cambon at London to inform Sir
Edward Grey, British Secretary for Foreign Affairs, of the following
facts of French and German military preparations, to show that, "if
France is resolved, it is not she who is taking aggressive steps."</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"Although Germany has made her covering dispositions a few
     hundred meters from the frontier, along the whole front from
     Luxemburg to the Vosges, and has transported her covering troops
     to their war positions, we have kept our troops ten kilometers
     from the frontier and forbidden them to approach nearer.</p>

     <p>"By leaving a strip of territory undefended against sudden
     aggression of the enemy, the Government of the republic hopes to
     prove that France does not bear, any more than Russia, the
     responsibility for the attack.</p>

     <p>"In order to be convinced of this, it is sufficient to compare
     the steps taken on the two sides of our frontier; in France
     soldiers who were on leave were not recalled until we were
     certain that Germany had done so five days before.</p>

     <p>"In Germany, not only have the garrison troops of Metz been
     pushed up to the frontier, but they have been reenforced by units
     transported by train from garrisons of the interior such as
     Trèves or Cologne; nothing like this has been done in France.</p>

     <p>"The arming of the frontier defenses (clearing of trees, placing
     of armament, construction of batteries, and strengthening of wire
     entanglements) was begun in Germany on Saturday, the 25th; with
     us it is going to be begun, for France can no longer refrain from
     taking similar measures.</p>

     <p>"The railway stations were occupied by the military in Germany on
     Saturday, the 25th; in France on Tuesday, the 28th.</p>

     <p>"Finally, in Germany the reservists by tens of thousands have
     been recalled by individual summons, those living abroad (the
     classes of 1903 to 1911) have been recalled, the officers of
     reserve have been summoned; in the interior the roads are closed,
     motor cars only circulate with permits. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page460" name="page460"></a>(p. 460)</span> It is the last
     stage before mobilization. None of these measures has been taken
     in France.</p>

     <p>"The German army has its outposts on our frontier; on two
     occasions yesterday German patrols penetrated our territory. The
     whole Sixteenth Army Corps from Metz, reenforced by part of the
     Eighth from Trèves and Cologne, occupies the frontier from Metz
     to Luxemburg; the Fifteenth Army Corps from Strassburg is massed
     on the frontier.</p>

     <p>"Under penalty of being shot, the inhabitants of the annexed
     parts of Alsace-Lorraine are forbidden to cross the frontier."</p>

<h3>FRIDAY, JULY 31, 1914</h3>

<p><i>Austria-Hungary.</i> On the following day Count Berchtold, Minister for
Foreign Affairs, telegraphed the ambassador at Berlin, Count Szögyény,
an account of the discussion on the 30th inst. between Sir Edward Grey,
British Secretary for Foreign Affairs, and the German Ambassador in
London, Prince Lichnowsky.</p>

<p>The ambassador was instructed to thank Secretary of State von Jagow for
communications made to Austria-Hungary</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"and to declare to him that in spite of the change in the
     situation which has since arisen through the mobilization of
     Russia, we are quite prepared to entertain the proposal of Sir
     Edward Grey to negotiate between us and Serbia.</p>

     <p>"The conditions of our acceptance are, nevertheless, that our
     military action against Serbia should continue to take its
     course, and that the British Cabinet should move the Russian
     Government to bring to a standstill the Russian mobilization
     which is directed against us, in which case, of course, we will
     also at once cancel the defensive military countermeasures in
     Galicia, which are occasioned by the Russian attitude."</p>
</div>

<p>Ambassador Szápáry telegraphed from St. Petersburg:</p>

     <p class="quote">"The order for the general mobilization of the entire [Russian]
     army and fleet was issued early to-day."</p>

<p>Count Berchtold notified the Austro-Hungarian representatives abroad:</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"As mobilization has been ordered by the Russian Government on
     our frontier, we find ourselves obliged to take military measures
     in Galicia.</p>

     <p>"These measures are purely of a defensive character and arise
     exclusively under the pressure of the Russian measures, which we
     regret exceedingly, as we ourselves have no aggressive intentions
     of any kind against Russia, and desire the continuation of the
     former neighborly relations.</p>

     <p>"<i>Pourparlers</i> between the Cabinets at Vienna and St. Petersburg
     appropriate <span class="pagenum"><a id="page461" name="page461"></a>(p. 461)</span> to the situation are meanwhile being
     continued, and from these we hope that things will quiet down all
     around."</p>
</div>

<p>Ambassador Szécsen telegraphed from Paris that the German Ambassador had
officially declared to France</p>

     <p class="quote">"that if the general mobilization ordered by the Russian
     Government is not stopped within twelve hours, Germany also will
     mobilize. At the same time Baron Schoen has asked whether France
     will remain neutral in the event of a war between Germany and
     Russia. An answer to this is requested within eighteen hours. The
     time limit expires to-morrow (Saturday) at one o'clock in the
     afternoon."</p>

<p>Ambassador Szápáry telegraphed from St. Petersburg that he had resumed
conversations with M. Sazonof, Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, but
that the "points of view on the two sides had not materially
approximated to each other."</p>

     <p class="quote">"Meanwhile, however, it has appeared from the conversations
     between the German Ambassador [Count Pourtalès] and M. Sazonof
     that Russia will not accept as satisfactory the formal
     declaration that Austria-Hungary will neither diminish the
     territory of the Serbian Kingdom nor infringe on Serbian
     sovereignty, nor injure Russian interests in the Balkans or
     elsewhere; since then, moreover, a general mobilization has been
     ordered on the part of Russia."</p>


<h4>FURTHER EXCHANGES BETWEEN WILLIAM AND NICHOLAS</h4>

<p><i>Germany.</i> The Czar sent the following telegram to William II:</p>

     <p class="quote">"I thank you cordially for your mediation, which permits the hope
     that everything may yet end peaceably. It is technically
     impossible to discontinue our military preparations, which have
     been made necessary by the Austrian mobilization. It is far from
     us to want war. As long as the negotiations between Austria and
     Serbia continue, my troops will undertake no provocative action.
     I give you my solemn word thereon. I confide with all my faith in
     the grace of God, and I hope for the success of your mediation in
     Vienna for the welfare of our countries and the peace of Europe."</p>

<p>This telegram of the Czar crossed with the following sent by the Kaiser,
at 2 p. m.:</p>

     <p class="quote">"Upon your appeal to my friendship and your request for my aid, I
     have engaged in mediation between your Government and the
     Government of Austria-Hungary. While this action was taking place
     your troops were being mobilized against my ally,
     Austria-Hungary, whereby, as I have <span class="pagenum"><a id="page462" name="page462"></a>(p. 462)</span> already
     communicated to you, my mediation has become almost illusory. In
     spite of this I have continued it, and now I receive reliable
     news that serious preparations for war are going on on my eastern
     frontier. The responsibility for the security of my country
     forces me to measures of defense. I have gone to the extreme
     limit of the possible in my efforts for the preservation of the
     peace of the world. It is not I who bear the responsibility for
     the misfortune which now threatens the entire civilized world. It
     rests in your hand to avert it. No one threatens the honor and
     peace of Russia which might well have awaited the success of my
     mediation. The friendship for you and your country, bequeathed to
     me by my grandfather on his deathbed, has always been sacred to
     me, and I have stood faithfully by Russia while it was in serious
     affliction, especially during its last war. The peace of Europe
     can still be preserved by you if Russia decides to discontinue
     those military preparations which menace Germany and
     Austria-Hungary."</p>

<p><i>Germany.</i> Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg telegraphed to Ambassador Von
Flotow at Rome:</p>

     <p class="quote">"We have continued to negotiate between Russia and
     Austria-Hungary through a direct exchange of telegrams between
     his Majesty the Kaiser and his Majesty the Czar, as well as in
     conjunction with Sir Edward Grey. Through the mobilization of
     Russia all our efforts have been greatly handicapped, if they
     have not become impossible. In spite of pacifying assurances
     Russia is taking such far-reaching measures against us that the
     situation is becoming continually menacing."</p>

<p>The Chancellor telegraphed to Ambassador Pourtalès at St. Petersburg:</p>

     <p class="quote">"In spite of negotiations still pending, and although we have up
     to this hour made no preparations for mobilization, Russia has
     mobilized her <i>entire</i> army and navy, hence also against us. On
     account of these Russian measures we have been forced, for the
     safety of the country, to proclaim the threatening state of war,
     which does not yet imply mobilization. Mobilization, however, is
     bound to follow if Russia does not stop every measure of war
     against us and against Austria-Hungary within twelve hours, and
     notifies us definitely to this effect. Please to communicate this
     at once to M. Sazonof and wire hour of communication."</p>

<p>The German White Book states that Count Pourtalès delivered the note at
midnight of this day (July 31).</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"The reply of the Russian Government has <i>never</i> reached us.</p>

     <p>"<i>Two hours after the expiration of the time limit</i> the czar
     telegraphed the kaiser as follows:</p>

     <p>"I have received your telegram. I comprehend that you are forced
     to mobilize, but I should like to have from you the same guaranty
     which I have given to you, viz., that these measures do not mean
     war, and that we shall continue to negotiate for the welfare of
     our two countries and the universal peace which is so dear to our
     hearts. With the aid of God it <span class="pagenum"><a id="page463" name="page463"></a>(p. 463)</span> must be possible to our
     long-tried friendship to prevent the shedding of blood. I expect
     with full confidence your urgent reply."</p>
</div>

<p>The Chancellor telegraphed to Ambassador Schoen at Paris:</p>

     <p class="quote">"Russia has ordered mobilization of her entire army and fleet,
     therefore also against us in spite of our still pending
     mediation. We have, therefore, declared the threatening state of
     war which is bound to be followed by mobilization unless Russia
     stops within twelve hours all measures of war against us and
     Austria. Mobilization inevitably implies war. Please ask French
     Government whether it intends to remain neutral in a Russo-German
     war. Reply must be made in eighteen hours. Wire at once hour of
     inquiry. Utmost speed necessary."</p>

<p>William II telegraphed to George V of Great Britain:</p>

     <p class="quote">"Many thanks for your friendly communication. Your proposals
     coincide with my ideas and with the communication which I have
     this evening received from Vienna, and which I have passed on to
     London. I have just heard from the chancellor that intelligence
     has just reached him that Nicholas this evening has ordered the
     mobilization of his entire army and fleet. He has not even
     awaited the result of the mediation in which I am engaged, and he
     has left me completely without information. I am traveling to
     Berlin to assure the safety of my eastern frontier, where strong
     Russian forces have already taken up their position."</p>

<p><i>Russia.</i> M. Schebeko, Ambassador at Vienna, telegraphed to M. Sazonof,
Minister for Foreign Affairs at St. Petersburg:</p>

     <p class="quote">"In spite of the general mobilization, my exchange of views with
     Count Berchtold and his colleagues continues. They all dwell upon
     the absence on Austria's part of any hostile intentions
     whatsoever against Russia, and of any designs of conquest at the
     expense of Serbia, but they are all equally insistent that
     Austria is bound to carry through the action which she has begun
     and to give Serbia a serious lesson, which would constitute a
     sure guaranty for the future."</p>

<p><i>Great Britain.</i> Ambassador Goschen telegraphed to Sir Edward Grey,
Secretary for Foreign Affairs:</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"The [German] Chancellor [Bethmann-Hollweg] informs me that his
     efforts to preach peace and moderation at Vienna have been
     seriously handicapped by the Russian mobilization against
     Austria. He has done everything possible to attain his object at
     Vienna, perhaps even rather more than was altogether palatable at
     the Ballplatz. He could not, however, leave his country
     defenseless while time was being utilized by other powers; and
     if, as he learns the case, military measures are now being taken
     by Russia against Germany also, it would be impossible for him to
     remain quiet. He wished to tell me that it was quite possible
     that in a very short time, to-day perhaps, the German Government
     would take some very serious step; he was, in fact, just on the
     point of going to have an audience with the emperor.</p>

     <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page464" name="page464"></a>(p. 464)</span> "His excellency added that the news of the active
     preparations on the Russo-German frontier had reached him just
     when the czar had appealed to the emperor, in the name of their
     old friendship, to mediate at Vienna, and when the emperor was
     actually conforming to that request."</p>
</div>

<p>Grey telegraphed to Ambassador Buchanan at St. Petersburg that a
conversation had taken place between Austria and Russia at Vienna, and
that one at St. Petersburg had been authorized by the Austrian Minister
for Foreign Affairs, Count Berchtold, in which Austria would explain the
ultimatum to Serbia and discuss any questions directly affecting
Austro-Russian relations.</p>

     <p class="quote">"I informed the German Ambassador that, as regards military
     preparations, I did not see how Russia could be urged to suspend
     them unless some limit were put by Austria to the advance of her
     troops into Serbia."</p>

<p>Grey telegraphed to Ambassador Goschen at Berlin his hope for a
satisfactory result from the Austro-Russian conversations.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"The stumblingblock hitherto has been Austrian mistrust of
     Serbian assurances, and Russian mistrust of Austrian intentions
     with regard to the independence and integrity of Serbia. It has
     occurred to me that, in the event of this mistrust preventing a
     solution being found by Vienna and St. Petersburg, Germany might
     sound Vienna, and I would undertake to sound St. Petersburg,
     whether it would be possible for the four disinterested powers to
     offer to Austria that they would undertake to see that she
     obtained full satisfaction of her demands on Serbia, provided
     that they did not impair Serbian sovereignty and the integrity of
     Serbian territory. As your excellency is aware, Austria has
     already declared her willingness to respect them. Russia might be
     informed by the four powers that they would undertake to prevent
     Austrian demands going the length of impairing Serbian
     sovereignty and integrity. All powers would of course suspend
     further military operations or preparations.</p>

     <p>"You may sound the Secretary of State [Von Jagow] about this
     proposal.</p>

     <p>"I said to German Ambassador [Prince Lichnowsky] this morning
     that if Germany could get any reasonable proposal put forward
     which made it clear that Germany and Austria were striving to
     preserve European peace, and that Russia and France would be
     unreasonable if they rejected it, I would support it at St.
     Petersburg and Paris, and go the length of saying that if Russia
     and France would not accept it his majesty's Government would
     have nothing more to do with the consequences; but, otherwise, I
     told German Ambassador that if France became involved we should
     be drawn in.</p>

     <p>"You can add this when sounding Chancellor [Bethmann-Hollweg] or
     Secretary of State as to proposal above."</p>
</div>

<p>Goschen telegraphed Grey that the whole Russian army and fleet were
mobilizing, and that <i>Kriegsgefahr</i> (imminence of war) <span class="pagenum"><a id="page465" name="page465"></a>(p. 465)</span> will be
proclaimed at once by Germany, as it can be only against her that
Russian general mobilization is directed. German mobilization would
follow almost immediately.</p>

<p>Ambassador Buchanan telegraphed from St. Petersburg that Russian general
mobilization had been ordered because of news from Vienna</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"that Austria is determined not to yield to intervention of
     powers, and that she is moving troops against Russia as well as
     against Serbia.</p>

     <p>"Russia has also reason to believe that Germany is making active
     military preparations, and she cannot afford to let her get a
     start."</p>
</div>

<p>Grey telegraphed to Ambassador Bertie at Paris:</p>

     <p class="quote">"I still trust that situation is not irretrievable, but in view
     of mobilization in Germany it becomes essential to his majesty's
     Government, in view of existing treaties, to ask whether French
     Government are prepared to engage to respect neutrality of
     Belgium so long as no other power violates it."</p>

<p>The same telegram, with change of words, "French Government" to "German
Government," was sent to Ambassador Goschen at Berlin. Grey asked Sir
Francis Villiers, Ambassador at Brussels, to inform M. Davignon, Belgian
Minister for Foreign Affairs, of these telegrams, and to say:</p>

     <p class="quote">"I assume that the Belgian Government will maintain to the utmost
     of their power their neutrality, which I desire and expect other
     powers to uphold and observe."</p>

<p>Grey telegraphed to Ambassador Bertie at Paris:</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"Nobody here feels that in this dispute, so far as it has yet
     gone, British treaties or obligations are involved. Feeling is
     quite different from what it was during the Morocco question.
     That crisis involved a dispute directly involving France, whereas
     in this case France is being drawn into a dispute which is not
     hers.</p>

     <p>"I believe it to be quite untrue that our attitude has been a
     decisive factor in situation. German Government do not expect our
     neutrality.</p>

     <p>"We cannot undertake a definite pledge to intervene in a war. I
     have so told the French Ambassador, who has urged his majesty's
     Government to reconsider this decision.</p>

     <p>"I have told him that we should not be justified in giving any
     pledge at the present moment, but that we will certainly consider
     the situation again directly there is a new development."</p>
</div>

<p>Bertie telegraphed to Grey that German Ambassador von Schoen had just
informed M. Viviani, French Minister for Foreign Affairs, that Germany
had addressed an ultimatum to Russia to demobilize, saying that, if it
were not complied with <span class="pagenum"><a id="page466" name="page466"></a>(p. 466)</span> within twenty-four hours, Germany would
order complete mobilization on Russian and French frontiers. Viviani
wishes to know what, in these circumstances, will be Great Britain's
attitude.</p>

     <p class="quote">"German Ambassador is going to call at the Ministry for Foreign
     Affairs to-morrow at 1 p. m. in order to receive the French
     Government's answer as to their attitude."</p>

<p>Grey telegraphed to Ambassador Bertie at Paris that French Ambassador
Jules Cambon at Berlin had reported to M. Paul Cambon, French Ambassador
at London, that uncertainty of Great Britain's intervention was
encouraging Germany in her warlike attitude, and that a definite
declaration by Great Britain on the side of Russia and France would
decide the German attitude in favor of peace.</p>

<p>Ambassador Buchanan telegraphed from St. Petersburg the following
proposition (sent also to France), made by M. Sazonof, Russian Minister
for Foreign Affairs:</p>

     <p class="quote">"If Austria will agree to check the advance of her troops on
     Serbian territory; if, recognizing that the dispute between
     Austria and Serbia has assumed a character of European interest,
     she will allow the great powers to look into the matter and
     determine whether Serbia could satisfy the Austro-Hungarian
     Government without impairing her rights as a sovereign state of
     her independence, Russia will undertake to maintain her waiting
     attitude."</p>

<p>M. Sazonof adduced the latest telegram of Nicholas II to William II as
proof of sincerity of Russia's attitude. He proposed that the conference
of the powers be held in London. He was grateful to Great Britain; if
peace were secured, it would be due largely to her efforts; Russia would
never forget her firm attitude.</p>

<p>Ambassador Goschen telegraphed from Berlin that he had spent an hour
with Secretary of State von Jagow, urging him to accept Grey's proposal
to make another effort to prevent the terrible catastrophe of a European
war.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"He appreciated your continued efforts to maintain peace, but
     said it was impossible for the Imperial Government to consider
     any proposal until they had received an answer from Russia to
     their communication of to-day [the ultimatum].</p>

     <p>"I asked his excellency why they had made their demand even more
     difficult for Russia to accept by asking them to demobilize in
     south as well. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page467" name="page467"></a>(p. 467)</span> He replied that it was in order to
     prevent Russia from saying all her mobilization was directed only
     against Austria.</p>

     <p>"His excellency said that if the answer from Russia was
     satisfactory he thought personally that your proposal merited
     favorable consideration, and in any case he would lay it before
     the emperor and chancellor.</p>

     <p>"He again assured me that both the Emperor William, at the
     request of the Emperor of Russia, and the German Foreign Office
     had even up till last night been urging Austria to show
     willingness to continue discussions&mdash;and telegraphic and the
     telephonic communications from Vienna had been of a promising
     nature&mdash;but Russia's mobilization had spoilt everything."</p>
</div>

<p>Ambassador Bertie telegraphed from Paris that he had presented to M.
Viviani, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Grey's inquiry concerning France
respecting Belgian neutrality.</p>

     <p class="quote">"He is urgently anxious as to what the attitude of England will
     be in the circumstances [which may arise from Germany's ultimatum
     to Russia.]"</p>

<p>The German Embassy is packing up.</p>

<p>In a supplementary telegram Bertie informed Grey:</p>

     <p class="quote">"French Government are resolved to respect the neutrality of
     Belgium, and it would be only in the event of some other power
     violating that neutrality that France might find herself under
     the necessity, in order to assure defense of her own security, to
     act otherwise. This assurance has been given several times.
     President of the Republic spoke of it to the King of the
     Belgians, and the French Minister at Brussels has spontaneously
     renewed the assurance to the Belgian Minister for Foreign Affairs
     to-day."</p>

<p><i>France.</i> Raymond Poincaré, President of France, informed George V that
Germany was pushing forward military preparations, especially on the
French frontier, while France had till now confined herself to
indispensable precautionary measures.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"We are, in spite of the moderation of the Government of the
     Republic and the calm of public opinion, on the eve of the most
     terrible events.</p>

     <p>"From all the information which reaches us it would seem that war
     would be inevitable if Germany were convinced that the British
     Government would not intervene in a conflict in which France
     might be engaged; if on the other hand, Germany were convinced
     that the <i>entente cordiale</i> would be affirmed, in case of need,
     even to the extent of taking the field side by side, there would
     be the greatest chance that peace would remain unbroken.</p>

     <p>"It is true that our military and naval arrangements leave
     complete liberty to your majesty's Government, and that, in the
     letters exchanged in 1912 between Sir Edward Grey and M. Paul
     Cambon, Great Britain and France entered into nothing more than a
     mutual agreement to consult one another in the event of European
     tension, and to examine in concert whether common action were
     advisable.</p>

     <p>"But the character of close friendship which public feeling has
     given in both countries to the <i>entente</i> between Great Britain
     and France, the confidence <span class="pagenum"><a id="page468" name="page468"></a>(p. 468)</span> with which our two
     governments have never ceased to work for the maintenance of
     peace, and the signs of sympathy which your majesty has ever
     shown to France, justify me in informing you quite frankly of the
     impressions of all France.</p>

     <p>"It is, I consider, on the language and the action of the British
     Government that henceforward the last chances of a peaceful
     settlement depend.</p>

     <p>"We, ourselves, from the initial stages of the crisis, have
     enjoined upon our ally [Russia] an attitude of moderation from
     which they have not swerved. In concert with your majesty's
     Government, and in conformity with Sir E. Grey's latest
     suggestions, we will continue to act on the same lines.</p>

     <p>"But if all efforts at conciliation emanate from one side, and if
     Germany and Austria can speculate on the abstention of Great
     Britain, Austria's demands will remain inflexible, and an
     agreement between her and Russia will become impossible. I am
     profoundly convinced that at the present moment, the more Great
     Britain, France and Russia can give a deep impression that they
     are united in their diplomatic action, the more possible will it
     be to count upon the preservation of peace.</p>

     <p>"I beg that your majesty will excuse a step which is inspired
     only by the hope of seeing the European balance of power
     definitely reaffirmed."</p>
</div>

<p>Ambassador Paul Cambon telegraphed from London of Grey's reply to
Germany on attitude of Great Britain in event of European war.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"The Cabinet Council took place this morning. After having
     examined the situation, the Cabinet thought that for the moment
     the British Government were unable to guarantee to us their
     intervention; that they intended to take steps to obtain from
     Germany and France an understanding to respect Belgian
     neutrality; but that before considering intervention it was
     necessary to wait for the situation to develop.</p>

     <p>"I asked Sir E. Grey if, before intervening, the British
     Government would await the invasion of French territory. I
     insisted on the fact that the measures already taken on our
     frontier by Germany showed an intention to attack in the near
     future, and that, if a renewal of the mistake of Europe in 1870
     was to be avoided, Great Britain should consider at once the
     circumstances in which she would give France the help on which
     she relied.</p>

     <p>"Sir E. Grey replied that the opinion of the Cabinet on the
     situation had been formed only at the moment; that the situation
     might be modified; and that in that case a meeting of the Cabinet
     would be called at once in order to consider it.</p>

     <p>"I am informed that the Cabinet will meet again to-morrow, and
     that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs will be certain
     to renew the discussion.</p>

     <p>"The letter which the President of the Republic has addressed to
     the King of England should be given to the king this evening.
     This step will, I am sure, be taken into serious consideration by
     the British Cabinet."</p>
</div>

<p>M. Viviani notified the Ambassadors at London, St. Petersburg, Berlin,
Vienna, and Rome, of France's agreement to the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page469" name="page469"></a>(p. 469)</span> proposal of
Great Britain to Austria-Hungary not to proceed further against Serbia
after occupying Belgrade, and to await mediation by the powers.</p>

     <p class="quote">"Sir E. Grey made this suggestion in the hope that military
     preparations would be suspended on all sides."</p>

<p>Russia had already agreed to stop military preparations if Austria
eliminated from her ultimatum to Serbia all points which endanger
Serbian sovereignty.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"Sir E. Grey thinks that, if Austria stops her advance after the
     occupation of Belgrade, the Russian Government could agree to
     change their formula in the following way:</p>

     <p>"That the powers would examine how Serbia should give complete
     satisfaction to Austria without endangering the sovereignty or
     independence of the kingdom. In case Austria should declare
     herself ready, in the interests of Europe, to stop her advance
     and to discuss how an arrangement might be arrived at, Russia
     could also consent to the discussion and suspend her military
     preparations, provided that the other powers acted in the same
     way."</p>
</div>

<p>M. Viviani telegraphed to the Ambassadors at London, St. Petersburg,
Berlin, Vienna, Rome, and Constantinople that negotiations had begun
again between Austria and Russia, the latter having accepted the formula
advised by Great Britain.</p>

     <p class="quote">"Nevertheless ... Germany ... has not ceased to encourage the
     uncompromising attitude of Vienna; the German military
     preparations continue; the immediate opposition of Germany to the
     Russian formula was declared at Berlin inacceptable for Austria
     before that power had even been consulted; in conclusion, all the
     impressions derived from Berlin bring conviction that Germany has
     sought to humiliate Russia, to disintegrate the Triple Entente,
     and if these results can not be obtained, to make war."</p>

<p>Ambassador Dumaine telegraphed from Vienna:</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"General mobilization for all men from nineteen to forty-two
     years of age was declared by the Austro-Hungarian Government this
     morning at one o'clock.</p>

     <p>"My Russian colleague [M. Schebeko] still thinks that this step
     is not entirely in contradiction to the declaration made
     yesterday by Count Berchtold [Austro-Hungarian Minister for
     Foreign Affairs]."</p>
</div>

<p>Ambassador Jules Cambon telegraphed from Berlin that Secretary of State
von Jagow had informed him that, in the face of total mobilization by
Russia, Germany had declared <i>Kriegsgefahrzustand</i> (imminence of war).
German Ambassador <span class="pagenum"><a id="page470" name="page470"></a>(p. 470)</span> Schoen had been instructed to ask France
what attitude she intended to adopt.</p>

<p>M. Viviani informed Ambassador Paléologue at St. Petersburg of the
Schoen interview and the ultimatum he had delivered, to be replied to on
the morrow (Saturday) at 1 p. m.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"I shall confine myself to telling him that France will have
     regard to her interests. The Government of the Republic need not
     indeed give any account of her intentions except to her ally.</p>

     <p>"I ask you to inform M. Sazonof [Minister for Foreign Affairs] of
     this immediately. As I have already told you, I have no doubt
     that the Imperial Government, in the highest interests of peace,
     will do everything on their part to avoid anything that might
     render inevitable or precipitate the crisis."</p>
</div>

<p>Minister Klobukowski telegraphed from Brussels that <i>L'Agence Havas</i>
having announced the proclamation of "imminence of war" in Germany, he
had assured M. Davignon, Minister for Foreign Affairs, that France would
respect Belgian neutrality.</p>

     <p class="quote">"The Russian and British Ministers appeared much pleased that in
     the circumstances I gave this assurance, which further, as the
     British Minister told me, was in accordance with the declaration
     of Sir E. Grey."</p>

<p><i>Belgium.</i> M. Davignon reported the above interview to the Belgian
Ministers at Berlin, Paris, and London, giving the exact words of the
French Minister:</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"No incursion of French troops into Belgium will take place, even
     if considerable forces are massed upon the frontiers of your
     country. France does not wish to incur the responsibility, so far
     as Belgium is concerned, of taking the first hostile act.</p>

     <p>"I thanked M. Klobukowski, and I felt bound to observe that we
     had always had the greatest confidence in the loyal observance by
     both our neighboring states of their engagements toward us. We
     have also every reason to believe that the attitude of the German
     Government will be the same as that of the Government of the
     French Republic."</p>
</div>

<p>M. Davignon telegraphed to all the Belgian Legations abroad:</p>

     <p class="quote">"The Minister of War informs me that [Belgian] mobilization has
     been ordered, and that Saturday, August 1, will be the first
     day."</p>

<p>He telegraphed to the Belgian Ministers at Berlin, London, and Paris,
that the British Minster had reported Sir Edward Grey's inquiry to
France and Germany if they would respect Belgian neutrality, and now
formally states that he presumes&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page471" name="page471"></a>(p. 471)</span> "that Belgium will do her utmost to maintain her
     neutrality, and that she desires and expects that the other
     powers will respect and maintain it.</p>

     <p>"I thanked Sir Francis Villiers for this communication, which the
     Belgian Government particularly appreciate, and I added that
     Great Britain and the other nations guaranteeing our independence
     could rest assured that we would neglect no effort to maintain
     our neutrality, and that we were convinced that the other powers,
     in view of the excellent relations of friendship and confidence
     which had always existed between us, would respect and maintain
     that neutrality.</p>

     <p>"I stated that our military forces, which had been considerably
     developed in consequence of our recent reorganization, were
     sufficient to enable us to defend ourselves energetically in the
     event of the violation of our territory.</p>

     <p>"In the course of the ensuing conversation, Sir Francis seemed to
     me somewhat surprised at the speed with which we had decided to
     mobilize our army. I pointed out to him that the Netherlands had
     come to a similar decision before we had done so, and that,
     moreover, the recent date of our new military system, and the
     temporary nature of the measures upon which we then had to
     decide, made it necessary for us to take immediate and thorough
     precautions. Our neighbors and guarantors should see in this
     decision our strong desire to uphold our neutrality ourselves.</p>

     <p>"Sir Francis seemed to be satisfied with my reply, and stated
     that his Government were awaiting this reply before continuing
     negotiations with France and Germany, the result of which would
     be communicated to me."</p>
</div>

<p>He telegraphed to the same ministers that the German Minister, Herr von
Below Saleske, had been informed of Belgium's military measures, and
that it was explained to him</p>

     <p>"a consequence of our desire to fulfill our international
     obligations, and that they in no wise implied an attitude of
     distrust toward our neighbors."</p>

<p>The German Minister was reminded of instructions his Chancellor,
Bethmann-Hollweg, had given to his predecessor, Herr von Flotow.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"In the course of the controversy which arose in 1911 as a
     consequence of the Dutch scheme for the fortification of
     Flushing, certain newspapers had maintained that in the case of a
     Franco-German war Belgian neutrality would be violated by
     Germany.</p>

     <p>"The [Belgian] Department of Foreign Affairs had suggested that a
     declaration in the German Parliament during a debate on foreign
     affairs would serve to calm public opinion, and to dispel the
     mistrust which was so regrettable from the point of view of the
     relations between the two countries.</p>

     <p>"Herr von Bethmann-Hollweg replied that he had fully appreciated
     the feelings which had inspired our representations. He declared
     that Germany had no intention of violating Belgian neutrality,
     but he considered that in making a public declaration Germany
     would weaken her military position in regard to France, who,
     secured on the northern side, would concentrate all her energies
     on the east.</p>

     <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page472" name="page472"></a>(p. 472)</span> "Since then, in 1913, Herr von Jagow [German Secretary
     of State] had made reassuring declarations to the Budget
     Commission of the Reichstag respecting the maintenance of Belgian
     neutrality.</p>

     <p>"Herr von Below replied that he knew of the conversation with
     Herr von Flotow, and that he was certain that the sentiments
     expressed at that time had not changed."</p>
</div>


<h3>SATURDAY, AUGUST 1, 1914</h3>

<p><i>Austria.</i> On the following day Count Szápáry, Ambassador at St.
Petersburg, telegraphed to Count Berchtold, Minister for Foreign
Affairs, an interview with the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs. "I
first warned M. Sazonof," said the count, "that in interpreting my
instructions to him I must leave out of account the new condition of
affairs in Vienna created by the general Russian mobilization. I then
said that it was a mistake that Austria had declined further
negotiations with Russia.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"Your excellency was not only quite prepared to deal with Russia
     on the broadest basis possible, but was also especially inclined
     to subject the text of our note to a discussion so far as its
     interpretation was concerned.</p>

     <p>"I could only hope that the course of events had not already
     taken us too far; in any case, I regarded it as my duty in the
     present moment of extreme anxiety to prove once again the good
     will of the Imperial and Royal Government. M. Sazonof replied
     that he took note with satisfaction of this proof of good will,
     but he desired to draw my attention to the fact that negotiations
     at St. Petersburg for obvious reasons appeared to promise less
     prospect of success than negotiations on the neutral <i>terrain</i> of
     London. I replied that your excellency, started from the point of
     view that direct contact should be maintained at St. Petersburg,
     so that I was not in a position to commit myself with regard to
     his suggestion as to London, but I would communicate on the
     subject with your excellency."</p>
</div>

<p><i>Germany.</i> The German White Book states:</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"As the time limit given to Russia had expired without the
     receipt of a reply to our inquiry, the kaiser ordered the
     mobilization of the entire German army and navy on August 1, at 5
     p. m.</p>

     <p>"The German Ambassador at St. Petersburg [Count Pourtalès] was
     instructed that, in the event of the Russian Government not
     giving a satisfactory reply within the stipulated time he should
     declare that we considered ourselves in a state of war after the
     refusal of our demands. [He so declared at 5 p. m.] However,
     before a confirmation of the execution of this order had been
     received, that is to say, already in the afternoon of August 1,
     Russian troops crossed our frontier and marched into German
     territory.</p>

     <p>"Thus Russia began the war against us.</p>

     <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page473" name="page473"></a>(p. 473)</span> "The French Prime Minister [M. Viviani] gave an
     equivocal and unsatisfactory reply on August 1 at 1 p. m., which
     gave no clear idea of the position of France, as he limited
     himself to the explanation that France would do that which her
     interests demanded. A few hours later, at 5 p. m., the
     mobilization of the entire French army and navy was ordered.</p>

     <p>"On the morning of the next day France opened hostilities."</p>
</div>

<p>Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg telegraphed to Ambassador Lichnowsky at
London:</p>

     <p class="quote">"Germany is ready to agree to the English proposal in the event
     of England guaranteeing with all her forces the unconditional
     neutrality of France in the conflict between Germany and Russia.
     Owing to the Russian challenge German mobilization occurred
     to-day before the English proposals were received. In consequence
     our advance to the French frontier cannot now be altered. We
     guarantee, however, that the French frontier will not be crossed
     by our troops until Monday, August 3, at 7 p. m., in case
     England's assent is received by that time."</p>

<p>Lichnowsky answered that Sir Edward Grey, British Secretary for Foreign
Affairs, had asked him</p>

     <p class="quote">"whether I thought I could declare that in the event of France
     remaining neutral in a German-Russian war we would not attack the
     French. I told him that I believed that I could assume
     responsibility for this."</p>

<p>At 5.30 p. m. the ambassador telegraphed that Grey had just read to him
the following unanimous declaration of the British Cabinet:</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"The reply of the German Government with regard to the neutrality
     of Belgium is a matter of very great regret, because the
     neutrality of Belgium does affect feeling in this country. If
     Germany could see her way to give the same positive reply as that
     which has been given by France, it would materially contribute to
     relieve anxiety and tension here, while, on the other hand, if
     there were a violation of the neutrality of Belgium by one
     combatant while the other respected it, it would be extremely
     difficult to restrain public feeling in this country.</p>

     <p>"On my question whether, on condition that we would maintain the
     neutrality of Belgium, he could give me a definite declaration
     with regard to the neutrality of Great Britain, the minister
     answered that that was impossible, but that this question would
     play a great part in public opinion in this country. If we
     violated Belgian neutrality in a war with France there would
     certainly be a change in public opinion which would make it
     difficult for the Cabinet here to maintain friendly neutrality.
     For the time there was not the slightest intention to proceed in
     a hostile manner against us. It would be their desire to avoid
     this if there was any possibility of doing so. It was, however,
     difficult to draw a line up to which we could go without
     intervention on this side. He turned again and again to Belgian
     neutrality, and was of opinion that this question would also play
     a great part.</p>

     <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page474" name="page474"></a>(p. 474)</span> "He had also thought whether it was not possible that we
     and France should, in case of a Russian war, stand armed opposite
     to one another without attacking. I asked him if he would be in a
     position to arrange that France would assent to an agreement of
     this kind. As we wanted neither to destroy France nor to annex
     portions of French territory, I could think that we would give
     our assent to an arrangement of this kind which would secure for
     us the neutrality of Great Britain. The minister said he would
     make inquiries; he also recognized the difficulties of holding
     back the military on both sides."</p>
</div>

<p>At 8.30 p. m. the ambassador telegraphed:</p>

     <p class="quote">"My communication of this morning is canceled by my communication
     of this evening. As there is no positive English proposal before
     us, any further step in the sense of the message I sent is
     superfluous."</p>

<p>At 7.10 p. m. Ambassador Pourtalès presented at St. Petersburg a note
repeating the ultimatum of July 31, and closing:</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"Russia having refused to comply with [not having considered it
     necessary to answer*] this demand, and having shown by this
     refusal [this attitude*] that her action was directed against
     Germany, I have the honor, on the instructions of my Government,
     to inform your excellency as follows:</p>

     <p>"His majesty the emperor, my august sovereign, in the name of the
     German Empire, accepts the challenge, and considers himself at
     war with Russia.</p>

     <p>"* The words in brackets occur in the original. It must be
     supposed that two variations had been prepared in advance, and
     that, by mistake, they were both inserted in the Note."</p>
</div>

<p><i>Russia.</i> A secret telegram was sent to Russian representatives abroad
announcing Germany's ultimatum delivered at midnight, and stating the
German Ambassador's reply to the inquiry if it meant war: "No, but we
are very near it."</p>

<p>Ambassador Benckendorff telegraphed from London that Sir Edward Grey,
Secretary for Foreign Affairs, hoped that no great power would open
hostilities before the formula for a peaceful settlement of the
disputes, accepted by Russia and offered to Germany, had been
considered. Later he telegraphed that France had agreed to respect the
neutrality of Belgium, but that Germany had stated she could give no
definite answer to the question.</p>

<p>Ambassador Isvolsky telegraphed from Paris:</p>

     <p class="quote">"The Austrian Ambassador [Count Szécsen] yesterday visited
     Viviani [Minister for Foreign Affairs] and declared to him that
     Austria, far from harboring any designs against the integrity of
     Serbia, was in fact ready to discuss the grounds of her
     grievances against Serbia with the other powers. The French
     Government are much exercised at Germany's extraordinary
     <span class="pagenum"><a id="page475" name="page475"></a>(p. 475)</span> military activity on the French frontier, for they are
     convinced that, under the guise of <i>Kriegszustand</i>, mobilization
     is in reality being carried out."</p>

<p>Later he telegraphed that, hearing from St. Petersburg of the German
order of general mobilization, President Poincaré had signed the order
for French mobilization.</p>

     <p class="quote">"The German Ambassador [Baron von Schoen] has just visited
     Viviani [Minister for Foreign Affairs] but told him nothing
     fresh, alleging the impossibility of deciphering the telegrams he
     has received. Viviani informed him of the signature of the order
     for mobilization issued in reply to that of Germany, and
     expressed to him his amazement that Germany should have taken
     such a step at a moment when a friendly exchange of views was
     still in progress between Russia, Austria, and the powers. He
     added that mobilization did not necessarily entail war, and that
     the German Ambassador might stay in Paris as the Russian
     Ambassador had remained in Vienna and the Austrian Ambassador in
     St. Petersburg."</p>

<p><i>Great Britain.</i> George V sent the following telegram to William II:</p>

     <p class="quote">"Many thanks for your telegram of last night. I have sent an
     urgent telegram to Nicholas, in which I have assured him of my
     readiness to do everything in my power to further the resumption
     of the negotiations between the powers concerned."</p>

<p>Upon receipt of the telegram from the German Kaiser of August 1, King
George replied that there must be a misunderstanding in regard to the
suggestion of the Secretary for Foreign Affairs, made to the German
Ambassador, respecting avoidance of conflict between Germany and France,
while the possibility remained of an agreement being arrived at between
Austria and Russia.</p>

     <p class="quote">"Sir Edward Grey will see Prince Lichnowsky early to-morrow
     morning in order to ascertain whether there is any
     misunderstanding on his side."</p>

<p>King George replied to the letter of President Poincaré of July 31,
assuring him of cooperation of their two Governments in the interest of
peace.</p>

     <p class="quote">"I admire the restraint which you and your Government are
     exercising in not adopting an attitude which could in any wise be
     interpreted as a provocative one."</p>

<p>Grey sent a personal message from King George to Nicholas II in which he
appealed to the czar to remove the misunderstanding that had evidently
produced the deadlock between Russia <span class="pagenum"><a id="page476" name="page476"></a>(p. 476)</span> and Germany, and offered
his assistance in reopening the conversations between Russia and
Austria.</p>

<p>The Czar replied to King George that attempts at peace had been that
afternoon rendered futile by Germany's declaration of war, which was
wholly unexpected by him, since he had given William II "most
categorical assurances that my troops would not move so long as
mediation negotiations continued."</p>

     <p class="quote">"In this solemn hour I wish to assure you once more that I have
     done all in my power to avert war. Now that it has been forced on
     me, I trust your country will not fail to support France and
     Russia. God bless and protect you."</p>

<p>Ambassador Bertie, telegraphing from Paris, reported an interview that
morning between the French Political Director and German Ambassador
Schoen.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"M. Berthelot pointed out that general mobilization in Russia had
     not been ordered until after Austria had decreed a general
     mobilization, and that the Russian Government were ready to
     demobilize if all powers did likewise. It seemed strange to the
     French Government that in view of this and of the fact that
     Russia and Austria were ready to converse, the German Government
     should have at that moment presented an ultimatum at St.
     Petersburg requiring immediate demobilization by Russia. There
     were no differences at issue between France and Germany, but the
     German Ambassador had made a menacing communication to the French
     Government and had requested an answer the next day, intimating
     that he would have to break off relations and leave Paris if the
     reply were not satisfactory. The French Government considered
     that this was an extraordinary proceeding.</p>

     <p>"The German Ambassador, who is to see the Minister for Foreign
     Affairs again this evening, said nothing about demanding his
     passports, but he stated that he had packed up."</p>
</div>

<p>Ambassador Bunsen telegraphed from Vienna that a general mobilization of
the Austro-Hungarian army and fleet had been ordered. Minister Villiers
telegraphed from Brussels:</p>

     <p class="quote">"Belgium expects and desires that other powers will observe and
     uphold her neutrality, which she intends to maintain to the
     utmost of her power. In so informing me, Minister for Foreign
     Affairs [Davignon] said that they believed that they were in a
     position to defend themselves against intrusion. The relations
     between Belgium and her neighbors were excellent, and there was
     no reason to suspect their intentions; but he thought it well,
     nevertheless, to be prepared against emergencies."</p>

<p>Grey telegraphed to Ambassador Goschen at Berlin that the Hamburg
authorities had detained British merchant ships on unknown <span class="pagenum"><a id="page477" name="page477"></a>(p. 477)</span>
grounds, and instructed him to request the German Government to order
their release.</p>

     <p class="quote">"The effect on public opinion here will be deplorable unless this
     is done. His majesty's Government, on their side, are most
     anxious to avoid any incident of an aggressive nature, and the
     German Government will, I hope, be equally careful not to take
     any step which would make the situation between us impossible."</p>

<p>Later Grey telegraphed Goschen that he still believed it possible to
secure peace if a little respite could be gained before any great power
began war. Russia and Austria had at last agreed to accept a basis of
mediation which is not open to objections raised to the original Russian
formula.</p>

     <p class="quote">"Things ought not to be hopeless so long as Austria and Russia
     are ready to converse, and I hope the German Government may be
     able to make use of the Russian communications referred to, in
     order to avoid tension. His majesty's Government are carefully
     abstaining from any act which may precipitate matters."</p>

<p>In following telegrams Grey sent Goschen the Russian formula as amended
by himself, and the acceptance of the same by Russia.</p>

<p>Ambassador Bertie telegraphed from Paris information received from
President Poincaré of German mobilization, etc., and Russia's desire to
continue pacific conversations with Germany.</p>

     <p class="quote">"The French Government, whose wishes are markedly pacific,
     sincerely desire the preservation of peace and do not quite
     despair, even now, of its being possible to avoid war."</p>

<p>Grey telegraphed to Ambassador Buchanan at St. Petersburg that reliable
news had come from Vienna that the Austro-Hungarian Government,</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"though the situation has been changed by the mobilization of
     Russia, would, in full appreciation of the efforts of England for
     the preservation of peace, be ready to consider favorably my
     proposal for mediation between Austria and Serbia. The effect of
     this acceptance would naturally be that the Austrian military
     action against Serbia would continue for the present, and that
     the British Government would urge upon Russian Government to stop
     the mobilization of troops directed against Austria, in which
     case Austria would naturally cancel those defensive military
     countermeasures in Galicia, which have been forced upon Austria
     by Russian mobilization.</p>

     <p>"You should inform Minister for Foreign Affairs [M. Sazonof] and
     say that if, in the consideration of the acceptance of mediation
     by Austria, Russia can agree to stop mobilization, it appears
     still to be possible to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page478" name="page478"></a>(p. 478)</span> preserve peace. Presumably the
     matter should be discussed with German Government also by Russian
     Government."</p>
</div>

<p>Ambassador Bertie telegraphed from Paris that orders for general
mobilization had been given at 3.30 p. m., in answer to the German
<i>Kriegsgefahrzustand</i> (imminence of war), which, by calling out troops
up to war strength, is tantamount to mobilization.</p>

     <p class="quote">"The Minister of War is anxious that it should be explained that
     this act of mobilization is one for purely defensive purposes."</p>

<p>Grey telegraphed to Ambassador Bunsen at Vienna an account of interviews
with the Austro-Hungarian Ambassador, in which Count Mensdorff gave him
assurances that Austria would not impair the territorial integrity or
sovereignty of Serbia, and said that, contrary to report, Austria was
willing to continue conversations with Russia.</p>

<p>Ambassador Buchanan telegraphed Grey of an interview that morning with
the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, in which M. Sazonof recounted
his conversation with Count Szápáry, the Austrian Ambassador, the
evening before, in which he proposed the London conference.</p>

<p>Ambassador Bunsen telegraphed Grey from Vienna that the Russian
Ambassador, Schebeko, thought that, as mobilization is too expensive to
be continued long, Germany will attack Russia at once. Tension now is
greater between Russia and Germany than between Russia and Austria.
Russia would be satisfied, says Schebeko, with Austria's acceptance of
the new formula.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"He is going again to-day to point out to the Minister for
     Foreign Affairs [Count Berchtold] that most terrific consequences
     must ensue from refusal to make this slight concession. This time
     Russia would fight to the last extremity. I agree with his
     excellency that the German Ambassador at Vienna desired war from
     the first, and that his strong personal bias probably colored his
     action here. The Russian Ambassador is convinced that the German
     Government also desired war from the first.</p>

     <p>"It is the intention of the French Ambassador [Dumaine] to speak
     earnestly to the Minister for Foreign Affairs to-day on the
     extreme danger of the situation, and to ask whether proposals to
     serve as a basis of mediation from any quarter are being
     considered. There is great anxiety to know what England will do.
     I fear that nothing can alter the determination of
     Austro-Hungarian Government to proceed on their present course,
     if they have made up their mind with the approval of Germany."</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page479" name="page479"></a>(p. 479)</span> Ambassador Goschen telegraphed from Berlin:</p>

     <p class="quote">"Orders have just been issued for the general mobilization of the
     navy and army, the first day of mobilization to be August 2."</p>

<p>Later he telegraphed that Secretary of State von Jagow had expressed
annoyance at detention of British ships at Hamburg, and promised to
order their immediate release.</p>

<p><i>France.</i> M. Viviani, Secretary of Foreign Affairs, informed the
ambassadors at London, St. Petersburg, Berlin, Vienna, and Rome of the
two <i>démarches</i> made on the previous evening at Paris and St.
Petersburg&mdash;"the one rather vague, the other precise and conciliatory."</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"Unfortunately these [latter] arrangements which allowed one to
     hope for a peaceful solution appear, in fact, to have been
     rendered useless by the attitude of Germany [in presenting her
     ultimatum to Russia].</p>

     <p>"The attitude of Germany proves that she wishes for war. And she
     wishes for it against France. [Here he recounted the interview
     with the German Ambassador Schoen at the French Foreign Office.]</p>

     <p>"This attitude of breaking off diplomatic relations without any
     direct dispute, and although he has not received any definitely
     negative answer, is characteristic of the determination of
     Germany to make war against France. The want of sincerity in her
     peaceful protestations is shown by the rupture which she is
     forcing upon Europe at a time when Austria had at last agreed
     with Russia to begin negotiations."</p>
</div>

<p>M. Jules Cambon, Ambassador at Berlin, reported Austria's willingness to
continue conversations with Russia.</p>

     <p class="quote">"The ultimatum to Russia can only do away with the last chances
     of peace which these conversations still seemed to leave. The
     question may be asked whether in such circumstances the
     acceptance by Austria was serious, and had not the object of
     throwing the responsibility of the conflict on to Russia."</p>

<p>He told of the interviews of the British Ambassador with Secretary of
State von Jagow, in which Mr. Goschen vainly pleaded that Germany use
her influence with Austria in the cause of peace.</p>

     <p class="quote">"Germany's ultimatum coming at the very moment when an agreement
     seemed about to be established between Vienna and St. Petersburg,
     is characteristic of her warlike policy."</p>

<p>It looks as if she desired war on her own account.</p>

<p>M. Viviani, Minister for Foreign Affairs, notified the ambassadors at
London and Berlin and the Minister of Brussels of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page480" name="page480"></a>(p. 480)</span> his pledge
to respect Belgian neutrality as given to Great Britain.</p>

<p>Ambassador Barrère reported from Rome an interview of the German
Ambassador with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in which Herr von
Flotow had asked the intentions of Italy in the present crisis.</p>

     <p class="quote">"The Marquis di San Giuliano answered that as the war undertaken
     by Austria was aggressive and did not fall within the purely
     defensive character of the Triple Alliance, particularly in view
     of the consequences which might result from it according to the
     declaration of the German Ambassador, Italy could not take part
     in the war."</p>

<p>M. Viviani reported to the ambassadors at London, St. Petersburg,
Berlin, Vienna, Rome, Madrid, and Constantinople the visit to him at 11
a. m. of German Ambassador Schoen.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"After having recalled all the efforts made by France toward an
     honorable settlement of the Austro-Serbian conflict and the
     difficulty between Austria and Russia which has resulted from it,
     I put him in possession of the facts as to the <i>pourparlers</i>
     which have been carried on since yesterday [in reference to
     Austro-Russian dispute].</p>

     <p>"I drew attention to the attitude of Germany who, abandoning all
     <i>pourparlers</i>, presented an ultimatum to Russia at the very
     moment when this power had just accepted the British formula
     (which implies the cessation of military preparations by all the
     countries which have mobilized) and regarded as imminent a
     diplomatic rupture with France.</p>

     <p>"Baron von Schoen answered that he did not know the developments
     which had taken place in this matter for the last twenty-four
     hours, that there was perhaps in them a 'glimmer of hope' for
     some arrangement, that he had not received any fresh
     communication from his Government, and that he was going to get
     information. He gave renewed protestations of his sincere desire
     to unite his efforts to those of France for arriving at a
     solution of the conflict. I laid stress on the serious
     responsibility which the Imperial Government would assume if, in
     circumstances such as these, they took an initiative which was
     not justified and of a kind which would irremediably compromise
     peace.</p>

     <p>"Baron von Schoen did not allude to his immediate departure and
     did not make any fresh request for an answer to his question
     concerning the attitude of France in case of an Austro-Russian
     conflict. He confined himself to saying of his own accord that
     the attitude of France was not doubtful.</p>

     <p>"It would not do to exaggerate the possibilities which may result
     from my conversation with the German Ambassador for, on their
     side, the Imperial Government continue the most dangerous
     preparations on our frontier. However, we must not neglect the
     possibilities, and we should not cease to work toward an
     agreement. On her side France is taking all military <span class="pagenum"><a id="page481" name="page481"></a>(p. 481)</span>
     measures required for protection against too great an advance in
     German military preparations. She considers that her attempts at
     solution will only have a chance of success so far as it is felt
     that she will be ready and resolute if the conflict is forced on
     her."</p>
</div>

<p>Ambassador Paul Cambon reported from London the situation between Great
Britain and Germany, especially in regard to British neutrality and
Germany's attitude toward Belgian neutrality.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"Sir Edward Grey will ask the Cabinet to authorize him to state
     on Monday in the House of Commons that the British Government
     will not permit a violation of Belgian neutrality.</p>

     <p>"In the second place, the British fleet is mobilized, and Sir
     Edward Grey will propose to his colleagues that he should state
     that it will oppose the passage of the Straits of Dover by the
     German fleet, or, if the German fleet should pass through, will
     oppose any demonstration on the French coasts. These two
     questions will be dealt with at the meeting on Monday. I drew the
     attention of the Secretary of State to the point that, if during
     this intervening period any incident took place, it was necessary
     not to allow a surprise, and that it would be desirable to think
     of intervening in time."</p>
</div>

<p>Minister Mollard presented the request from Dr. Eyschen, Minister of
State of Luxemburg, for an assurance that France would respect the
neutrality of the Grand Duchy. A similar request has been made to
Germany.</p>

<p>M. Viviani returned the same assurance that he had given in the case of
Belgium.</p>

<p><i>Belgium.</i> M. Davignon, Minister for Foreign Affairs, telegraphed to the
Ministers at Paris, Berlin, London, Vienna, and St. Petersburg to carry
out the instructions [in case of war between France and Germany becoming
imminent] of July 24; and to the Ministers at Rome, The Hague, and
Luxemburg to carry out instructions [the same] of July 25.</p>


<h3>SUNDAY, AUGUST 2, 1914</h3>

<p><i>Austria-Hungary.</i> On the following day, Ambassador Szögyény telegraphed
from Berlin that no answer had been received from Russia to Germany's
demand that she demobilize; that Russian troops had crossed the German
frontier at Schwidden (southeast of Bialla); and that Germany therefore
regarded herself at war <span class="pagenum"><a id="page482" name="page482"></a>(p. 482)</span> with Russia and had that morning given
Ambassador Swerbeiev his passports.</p>

<p><i>Germany.</i> Ambassador Lichnowsky telegraphed from London to Chancellor
von Bethmann-Hollweg that Sir Edward Grey, British Secretary for Foreign
Affairs, had given up as impracticable his suggestions as to the
possibility of creating lasting British neutrality, which were made
without previous inquiry of France and without knowledge of
mobilization.</p>


<p>RUSSIA EXPLAINS HER EFFORTS FOR PEACE</p>

<p><i>Russia.</i> M. Sazonof, Minister for Foreign Affairs, published an
announcement respecting recent events in correction of a "garbled
version" appearing in the foreign press. This recited the circumstances
of the Austrian note of July 23 to Serbia and Serbia's reply of the
25th.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"Russia considered that the humiliation of Serbia, involved in
     these demands, and equally the evident intention of
     Austria-Hungary to secure her own hegemony in the Balkans, which
     underlay her conditions, were inadmissible. The Russian
     Government, therefore, pointed out to Austria-Hungary in the most
     friendly manner that it would be desirable to re-examine the
     points contained in the Austro-Hungarian note. The
     Austro-Hungarian Government did not see their way to agree to a
     discussion of the note. The moderating influence of the four
     powers at Vienna was equally unsuccessful....</p>

     <p>"The Austro-Hungarian Government proceeded to mobilize and
     declared war officially against Serbia, and the following day
     Belgrade was bombarded. The manifesto which accompanied the
     declaration of war openly accuses Serbia of having prepared and
     carried out the crime of Sarajevo. Such an accusation of a crime
     at common law, launched against a whole people and a whole State,
     aroused, by its evident inanity, widespread sympathy for Serbia
     throughout all classes of European society.</p>

     <p>"In consequence of this behavior of the Austro-Hungarian
     Government, in spite of Russia's declaration that she could not
     remain indifferent to the fate of Serbia, the Russian Government
     considered it necessary to order mobilization in the military
     districts of Kiev, Odessa, Moscow, and Kazan. This decision was
     rendered necessary by the fact that since the date when the
     Austro-Hungarian note was communicated to the Serbian Government,
     and since the first steps taken by Russia, five days had elapsed,
     and yet the Vienna Cabinet had not taken one step to meet Russia
     halfway in her efforts towards peace. Indeed, quite the contrary;
     for the mobilization of half of the Austro-Hungarian army had
     been ordered.</p>

     <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page483" name="page483"></a>(p. 483)</span> "The German Government were kept informed of the steps
     taken by Russia. At the same time it was explained to them that
     these steps were only the result of the Austrian preparations,
     and that they were not in any way aimed at Germany.
     Simultaneously, the Russian Government declared that Russia was
     ready to continue discussions with a view to a peaceful
     settlement of the dispute, either in the form of direct
     negotiations with Vienna or, as suggested by Great Britain, in
     the form of a conference of the four great powers not directly
     interested, that is to say, Great Britain, France, Germany, and
     Italy.</p>

     <p>"This attempt on the part of Russia was, however, equally
     unsuccessful. Austria-Hungary declined a further exchange of
     views with Russia, and the Vienna Cabinet was unwilling to join
     the proposed conference of the powers.</p>

     <p>"Nevertheless Russia did not abandon her efforts for peace. When
     questioned by the German Ambassador as to the conditions on which
     we would still agree to suspend our preparations, the Minister
     for Foreign Affairs declared that these conditions were Austria's
     recognition that the Austro-Serbian question had assumed a
     European character, and a declaration by her that she agreed not
     to insist upon such of her demands as were incompatible with the
     sovereign rights of Serbia.</p>

     <p>"Germany considered this Russian proposal unacceptable to
     Austria-Hungary. At that very moment news of the proclamation of
     general mobilization by Austria-Hungary reached St. Petersburg.</p>

     <p>"All this time hostilities were continuing on Serbian territory,
     and Belgrade was bombarded afresh.</p>

     <p>"The failure of our proposals for peace compelled us to extend
     the scope of our precautionary military measures.</p>

     <p>"The Berlin Cabinet questioned us on this, and we replied that
     Russia was compelled to begin preparations so as to be ready for
     every emergency.</p>

     <p>"But while taking this precautionary step, Russia did not on that
     account abandon her strenuous efforts to find some solution of
     the situation, and she announced that she was ready to accept any
     proposed settlement of the problem that might be put forward,
     provided it complied with the conditions laid down by her.</p>

     <p>"In spite of this conciliatory communication, the German
     Government on July 31 demanded of the Russian Government that
     they should suspend their military measures by midday on August
     1, and threatened, should they fail to comply, to proceed to
     general mobilization.</p>

     <p>"On the following day, August 1, the German Ambassador, on behalf
     of his Government, forwarded a declaration of war to the Minister
     for Foreign Affairs."</p>
</div>

<p>M. Sazonof telegraphed to the Russian representatives abroad</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"that Germany is now doing her utmost to foist upon us the
     responsibility for the rupture. We were forced to mobilize by the
     immense responsibility which would have fallen upon our shoulders
     if we had not taken all possible precautionary measures at a time
     when Austria, while confining herself to discussions of a
     dilatory nature, was bombarding Belgrade and was undertaking
     general mobilization.</p>

     <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page484" name="page484"></a>(p. 484)</span> "The Emperor of Russia had promised the German Emperor
     that he would take no aggressive action as long as the
     discussions with Austria continued. With such a guarantee, and
     after so many proofs of Russia's desire for peace, Germany
     neither could, nor had the right to, doubt our declaration that
     we would joyfully accept any peaceful settlement compatible with
     the dignity and independence of Serbia. Any other solution,
     besides being entirely incompatible with our own dignity, would
     assuredly have upset the European balance of power by securing
     the hegemony of Germany. The European&mdash;nay, the
     world-wide&mdash;character of this dispute is infinitely more
     important than the pretext from which it springs. By her decision
     to declare war upon us, at a moment when negotiations were in
     progress between the powers, Germany has assumed a heavy
     responsibility."</p>
</div>

<p><i>Great Britain.</i> Ambassador Goschen sent from Berlin two telegrams to
Sir Edward Grey, Secretary for Foreign Affairs, one stating that
Secretary of State von Jagow had just informed him that, owing to
certain Russian troops having crossed the frontier, Germany and Russia
were in a state of war, and the other that the reason for the detention
of British ships on the day preceding was laying of mines and taking
other precautions.</p>

<p>Ambassador Villiers telegraphed from Brussels that a German force had
entered Luxemburg. This was confirmed by a telegram from the Minister of
State for Luxemburg, who gave details, and added:</p>

     <p class="quote">"These occurrences constitute acts which are manifestly contrary
     to the neutrality of the Grand Duchy as guaranteed by the Treaty
     of London of 1867. The Luxemburg Government have not failed to
     address an energetic protest against this aggression to the
     representatives of his majesty the German Emperor at Luxemburg.
     An identical protest will be sent by telegraph to the Secretary
     of State for Foreign Affairs at Berlin. [Paris was also
     informed.]"</p>

<p>Grey telegraphed Ambassador Bertie at Paris:</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"After the Cabinet this morning I gave M. Cambon [French
     Ambassador in London] the following memorandum:</p>

     <p>"I am authorized to give an assurance that, if the German fleet
     comes into the Channel or through the North Sea to undertake
     hostile operations against French coasts or shipping, the British
     fleet will give all the protection in its power.</p>

     <p>"This assurance is of course subject to the policy of his
     majesty's Government receiving the support of Parliament, and
     must not be taken as binding his majesty's Government to take any
     action until the above contingency of action by the German fleet
     takes place.</p>

     <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page485" name="page485"></a>(p. 485)</span> "I pointed out that we had very large questions and most
     difficult issues to consider, and that our Government felt that
     they could not bind themselves to declare war upon Germany
     necessarily if war broke out between France and Germany
     to-morrow, but it was essential to the French Government, whose
     fleet had long been concentrated in the Mediterranean, to know
     how to make their dispositions with their north coast entirely
     undefended. We therefore thought it necessary to give them this
     assurance. It did not bind us to go to war with Germany unless
     the German fleet took the action indicated, but it did not give a
     security to France that would enable her to settle the
     disposition of her own Mediterranean fleet.</p>

     <p>"M. Cambon asked me about the violation of Luxemburg. I told him
     the doctrine on that point laid down by Lord Derby and Lord
     Clarendon in 1867. He asked me what we should say about the
     violation of the neutrality of Belgium. I said that was a much
     more important matter; we were considering what statement we
     should make in Parliament to-morrow&mdash;in effect, whether we should
     declare violation of Belgian neutrality to be a <i>casus belli</i>. I
     told him what had been said to the German Ambassador on this
     point."</p>
</div>

<p><i>France.</i> Ambassador Paléologue telegraphed from St. Petersburg that the
German Ambassador, Count Pourtalés was leaving the Russian capital that
day, and that the Austro-Hungarian Ambassador, Count Szápáry had not yet
received instructions from Vienna as to the declaration of war.</p>

<p>M. Viviani, Minister for Foreign Affairs, notified the Ambassadors at
London, St. Petersburg, Berlin, Vienna, Rome, Madrid, and
Constantinople:</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"This morning, French territory was violated by German troops at
     Ciry and near Longwy. They are marching on the fort which bears
     the latter name. Elsewhere the Custom House at Delle has twice
     been fired upon. Finally, German troops have also violated this
     morning the neutral territory of Luxemburg.</p>

     <p>"You will at once use this information to lay stress on the fact
     that the German Government is committing itself to acts of war
     against France without provocation on our part, or any previous
     declaration of war, whilst we have scrupulously respected the
     zone of ten kilometers which we have maintained, even since the
     mobilization, between our troops and the frontier."</p>
</div>

<p>Ambassador Paul Cambon reported from London Sir Edward Grey's
declaration of the British Cabinet as to protection of France by the
British fleet.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"Afterwards in speaking to me of the neutrality of Belgium and
     that of Luxemburg, the Secretary of State reminded me that the
     Convention of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page486" name="page486"></a>(p. 486)</span> 1867, referring to the Grand Duchy,
     differed from the Treaty referring to Belgium, in that Great
     Britain was bound to require the observance of this latter
     Convention without the assistance of the other guaranteeing
     powers, while with regard to Luxemburg all the guaranteeing
     powers were to act in concert.</p>

     <p>"The protection of Belgian neutrality is here considered so
     important that Great Britain will regard its violation by Germany
     as a <i>casus belli</i>. It is a specially British interest and there
     is no doubt that the British Government, faithful to the
     traditions of their policy, will insist upon it, even if the
     business world in which German influence is making tenacious
     efforts, exercises pressure to prevent the Government committing
     itself against Germany."</p>
</div>

<p>M. Viviani replied to M. Paul Cambon that the promise of the British
Cabinet was "a first assistance which is most valuable to us."</p>

     <p class="quote">"The help which Great Britain intends to give to France for the
     protection of the French coasts or the French merchant marine,
     will be used in such a way that our navy will also, in case of a
     Franco-German conflict, be supported by the British fleet in the
     Atlantic as well as in the North Sea and Channel. I would note
     that British ports could not serve as places for revictualling
     for the German fleet."</p>

<p>M. Viviani telegraphed to Ambassador Jules Cambon at Berlin to protest
to the German Government against the violation of the French frontier by
German armed forces, as "unjustified by anything in the present
situation."</p>

     <p class="quote">"The Government of the Republic can only leave to the Imperial
     Government the entire responsibility for these acts."</p>

<p>M. Marcellin Pellet, Minister at the Hague, telegraphed to M. Viviani
that the German Minister had called on M. Loudon, Dutch Minister for
Foreign Affairs, to explain the necessity for the German violation of
the neutrality of Luxemburg.</p>

<p><i>Belgium.</i> M. Davignon, Secretary for Foreign Affairs, telegraphed to
the ministers at Paris, Berlin, London, Vienna, and St. Petersburg, that
he had warned the German Minister at Brussels, Herr von Below Saleske,
that the French Minister, M. Klobukowski, would publish the formal
declaration made by the German Minister on August 1, respecting Belgian
neutrality.</p>

     <p class="quote">"When I next met Herr von Below he thanked me for this attention,
     and added that up to the present he had not been instructed to
     make us an official communication, but that we knew his personal
     opinion as to the feelings of security, which we had the right to
     entertain toward our <span class="pagenum"><a id="page487" name="page487"></a>(p. 487)</span> eastern neighbors. I at once
     replied that all that we knew of their intentions, as indicated
     in numerous previous conversations, did not allow us to doubt
     their perfect correctness toward Belgium. I added, however, that
     we should attach the greatest importance to the possession of a
     formal declaration, which the Belgian nation would hear of with
     joy and gratitude."</p>

<p>Later, the German Minister presented the following "very confidential"
note to Belgium.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <h4>GERMAN DECLARATION OF INTENTIONS TOWARD BELGIUM</h4>

     <p>"Reliable information has been received by the German Government
     to the effect that French forces intend to march on the line of
     the Meuse by Givet and Namur. This information leaves no doubt as
     to the intention of France to march through Belgian territory
     against Germany.</p>

     <p>"The German Government cannot but fear that Belgium, in spite of
     the utmost good will, will be unable, without assistance, to
     repel so considerable a French invasion with sufficient prospect
     of success to afford an adequate guaranty against danger to
     Germany. It is essential for the self-defense of Germany that she
     should anticipate any such hostile attack. The German Government
     would, however, feel the deepest regret if Belgium regarded as an
     act of hostility against herself the fact that the measures of
     Germany's opponents force Germany, for her own protection, to
     enter Belgian territory.</p>

     <p>"In order to exclude any possibility of misunderstanding, the
     German Government make the following declaration:</p>

     <p>"1. Germany has in view no act of hostility against Belgium. In
     the event of Belgium being prepared in the coming war to maintain
     an attitude of friendly neutrality toward Germany, the German
     Government bind themselves, at the conclusion of peace, to
     guarantee the possessions and independence of the Belgian Kingdom
     in full.</p>

     <p>"2. Germany undertakes, under the above-mentioned condition, to
     evacuate Belgian territory on the conclusion of peace.</p>

     <p>"3. If Belgium adopts a friendly attitude, Germany is prepared,
     in cooperation with the Belgian authorities, to purchase all
     necessaries for her troops against a cash payment, and to pay an
     indemnity for any damage that may have been caused by German
     troops.</p>

     <p>"4. Should Belgium oppose the German troops, and in particular
     should she throw difficulties in the way of their march by a
     resistance of the fortresses on the Meuse, or by destroying
     railways, roads, tunnels, or other similar works, Germany will,
     to her regret, be compelled to consider Belgium as an enemy.</p>

     <p>"In this event Germany can undertake no obligations toward
     Belgium, but the eventual adjustment of the relations between the
     two States must be left to the decision of arms.</p>

     <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page488" name="page488"></a>(p. 488)</span> "The German Government, however, entertain the distinct
     hope that this eventuality will not occur, and that the Belgian
     Government will know how to take the necessary measures to
     prevent the occurrence of incidents such as those mentioned. In
     this case the friendly ties which bind the two neighboring States
     will grow stronger and more enduring."</p>
</div>


<h3>MONDAY, AUGUST 3, 1914</h3>

<p><i>Serbia.</i> On the following day M. Yov. Yovanovitch, former Minister to
Vienna, and now at Nish, the temporary capital of Serbia, made a long
report to M. N. Pashitch, the Prime Minister, of events at Vienna from
the days following the crime of Sarajevo to his departure from the
Austrian capital. The points in this are:</p>


<h4>SERBIA'S POSITION EXPLAINED</h4>

<p>1. Constant police surveillance of the Serbian legation and menacing
attitude of the public.</p>

<p>2. Sudden change early in July of Austro-Hungarian attitude to the
Sarajevo incident. Press begins to represent it as a manifestation of
Serbian intrigue which Austria must settle, and alone, with
Serbia&mdash;eventually by war.</p>

<p>3. Assistance given by German Embassy to this press agitation.</p>

<p>4. Austrian financiers declare that "a settlement with Serbia" is the
only way out of the general financial and economic crisis prevailing in
Austria-Hungary since annexation of Bosnia. Gold secretly and gradually
withdrawn from circulation.</p>

<p>5. Austrian Minister of War, Krobatin, and Chief of Staff, Hetzendorf,
break leave of absence to return to Vienna, the latter having had a
conversation at Carlsbad with German Chief of Staff, Count Moltke.</p>

<p>6. Reserves retained after stipulated period for maneuvers had expired
and their numbers augmented.</p>

<p>7. Noncommittal answers of Count Tisza, Hungarian Prime Minister, to
interpolations concerning Serbia in Hungarian Diet.</p>

<p>8. Refusal at Foreign Office in Vienna to discuss Sarajevo incident with
foreign representatives, or if subject was mentioned, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page489" name="page489"></a>(p. 489)</span>
assurances that nothing would be done against Serbia to give uneasiness
to the powers, in particular Russia. Foreign ambassadors, thus assured,
quit Vienna on long leaves of absence for watering places. All this
indicates that Austria-Hungary was contemplating sudden action, which,
when a <i>fait accompli</i>, would likely be accepted by the powers in order
to avoid a general war.</p>

<p>9. German Ambassador, Herr von Tschirschky, the only foreign
representative informed of note to Serbia. He knew its minutest details,
and there is reason to believe he helped draft it.</p>

<p>10. When note was published, French, British, and Russian
representatives at Vienna asked me if it were not better to accept the
demands and avoid war for the present.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"I said that the note, which amounted in fact to a declaration of
     war upon Serbia, was worded in such a way that, even if Serbia
     should accept all the conditions without reserve, Austria-Hungary
     would still find an excuse for her army to march into Serbia at
     any time. It was in the belief that the conflict would be limited
     to Serbia and Austria-Hungary that Austria-Hungary had drafted
     such a note.</p>

     <p>"The Russian Ambassador, M. Schebeko [then absent from Vienna,]
     previously to the presentation of the note, had stated on several
     occasions to his colleagues and the Austro-Hungarian Government
     that Russia could not remain indifferent to any step taken by
     Austria-Hungary, which might have as an object the humiliation of
     Serbia. Hence the apprehension felt by the French and British
     Ambassadors and the Russian Chargé d'Affaires, who at once
     foresaw the possibility of war between Russia and
     Austria-Hungary."</p>
</div>

<p>11. Expressed intention of Count Berchtold, Austro-Hungarian Minister of
Foreign Affairs, to chastise Serbia by arms without consent of European
concert. Belief expressed by German Ambassador that Russia would permit
this, owing to troubles in Asia, and assurances given by him that
Germany would stand by her ally in the matter.</p>

     <p class="quote">"These statements of Herr von Tschirschky have induced many to
     hold the opinion that Germany desired to provoke a European war,
     on the ground that it was better to have war with Russia before
     the latter had completed her military reorganization, <i>i.e.</i>,
     before the spring of 1917. This point of view had formerly been
     freely discussed and even written about in Vienna. 'The longer
     the matter is postponed, the smaller will become the chances of
     success of the Triple Alliance.' On the other hand, rumors from
     the most authoritative diplomatic sources in Berlin reached me in
     Vienna, to the effect that the Wilhelmstrasse [German Foreign
     <span class="pagenum"><a id="page490" name="page490"></a>(p. 490)</span> Office] did not approve of Austria's policy on this
     question, and that Herr von Tschirschky has exceeded the
     instructions given to him."</p>

<p><i>Great Britain.</i> Sir Edward Grey, Secretary for Foreign Affairs, made a
statement in the House of Commons as to the diplomatic situation,
particularly of Great Britain. The chief points in it were:</p>

<p>1. The peace of Europe cannot be preserved, despite Great Britain's
earnest and consistent efforts to that end.</p>

<p>2. Great Britain's good faith in this matter is proved by her actions in
the Balkan crisis, where it was generally admitted she worked for peace.</p>

<p>3. Parliament is free to decide on attitude of Great Britain.</p>

<p>Here the secretary referred to the Moroccan crisis of 1906, and said
that then he had taken the same attitude with respect to France.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"That position was accepted by the French Government, but they
     said to me at the time, and I think very reasonably, 'If you
     think it possible that the public opinion of Great Britain might,
     should a sudden crisis arise, justify you in giving to France the
     armed support which you cannot promise in advance, you will not
     be able to give that support, even if you wish it, when the time
     comes, unless some conversations have already taken place between
     naval and military experts.' There was force in that. I agreed to
     it, and authorized those conversations to take place, but on the
     distinct understanding that nothing which passed between military
     or naval experts should bind either Government or restrict in any
     way their freedom to make a decision as to whether or not they
     would give that support when the time arose.</p>

     <p>"As I have told the House, upon that occasion a general election
     was in prospect; I had to take the responsibility of doing that
     without the Cabinet. It could not be summoned. An answer had to
     be given. I consulted Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, the Prime
     Minister; I consulted Lord Haldane, who was then Secretary of
     State for War; and the present Prime Minister [Henry Asquith] who
     was then Chancellor of the Exchequer. They authorized that
     [answer], on the distinct understanding that it left the hands of
     the Government free whenever the crisis arose."</p>
</div>

<p>Here the secretary read his reply to the French Ambassador, dated
November 22, 1912, which was to the effect stated. It instanced the
disposition of the French and British fleets at the time as "not based
upon an engagement to cooperate in war," and went on to say</p>

     <p class="quote">"that, if either Government had grave reason to expect an
     unprovoked attack by a third power, or something that threatened
     the general peace, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page491" name="page491"></a>(p. 491)</span> it should immediately discuss with
     the other whether both governments should act together to prevent
     aggression and to preserve peace, and, if so what measures they
     would be prepared to take in common."</p>

<p>The secretary said that the present crisis involved Great Britain's
obligations to France in a less formal fashion.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"While we were pledged to give nothing but diplomatic support to
     France in the Morocco affairs, we were pledged to do so by a
     definite public agreement [the Treaty of April 8, 1904]. But no
     Government and no country has less desire to be involved in war
     over a dispute with Austria and Serbia than the Government and
     the country of France. France is involved in it because of her
     obligation of honor under a definite alliance with Russia. It is
     only fair to the House to say that that obligation cannot apply
     in the same way to us. We are not parties to the Franco-Russian
     alliance. We do not even know its terms.</p>

     <p>"I now come to what we think the situation requires of us. We
     have had a long-standing friendship with France. But how far that
     friendship entails obligation, let every man look into his own
     heart, and his own feelings, and construe for himself.</p>

     <p>"The French coasts are absolutely undefended. The French fleet is
     in the Mediterranean, and has for some years been concentrated
     there because of the feeling of confidence and friendship which
     has existed between the two countries. My own feeling is that if
     a foreign fleet, engaged in a war which France had not sought,
     and in which she had not been the aggressor, came down the
     English Channel and bombarded and battered the undefended coasts
     of France, we could not stand aside, and see this going on
     practically within sight of our eyes, with our arms folded,
     looking on dispassionately, doing nothing.</p>

     <p>"Let us assume that out of the situation come consequences
     unforeseen, which make it necessary at a sudden moment that, in
     defense of vital British interests, we should go to war; and let
     us assume&mdash;which is quite possible&mdash;that Italy, who is now
     neutral, should depart from her attitude, what then will be the
     position in the Mediterranean where our trade routes are vital to
     our interests? We have not kept a fleet in the Mediterranean
     which is equal to dealing alone with a combination of other
     fleets in the Mediterranean. We would have exposed this country
     from our negative attitude at the present moment to the most
     appalling risk. We feel strongly that France was entitled to
     know&mdash;and to know at once&mdash;whether or not in the event of attack
     upon her unprotected northern and western coasts she could depend
     upon British support. In these compelling circumstances,
     yesterday afternoon I gave to the French Ambassador the assurance
     that if the German fleet undertakes hostile operations against
     the French coast or shipping the British fleet will give all the
     protection in its power, subject to the ratification of
     Parliament.</p>

     <p>"I understand that the German Government would be prepared, if we
     would pledge ourselves to neutrality, to agree that its fleet
     would not attack the northern coast of France. It is far too
     narrow an engagement <span class="pagenum"><a id="page492" name="page492"></a>(p. 492)</span> for us. And, Sir, there is the
     more serious consideration&mdash;becoming more serious every hour&mdash;of
     the neutrality of Belgium."</p>
</div>

<p>Here the secretary discussed the treaties of 1839 and of 1870 between
the powers and Belgium respecting preservation of her neutrality, and
cited in particular the real and written recognition by Prince Bismarck
of the sacredness of this neutrality, and the speech in Parliament by
William E. Gladstone on Great Britain's obligation to maintain it.</p>

<p>He then reported the promise he had just secured from France to respect
Belgian neutrality, the evasive answer that had been given by Germany in
regard to the same, and Belgium's promise to maintain her neutrality.</p>

<p>He then recited Germany's ultimatum to Belgium, and Belgium's appeal to
King George.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"Diplomatic intervention took place last week on our part. What
     can diplomatic intervention do now? We have great and vital
     interests in the independence&mdash;and integrity is the least
     part&mdash;of Belgium. The smaller States in that region of Europe ask
     but one thing, to be left alone and independent. If in this war
     which is before Europe the neutrality of one of those countries
     is violated, and no action be taken [by the powers] to resent it,
     at the end of the war, whatever the integrity may be, the
     independence will be gone. Mr. Gladstone said:</p>

     <p>"We have an interest in the independence of Belgium which is
     wider than that which we may have in the literal operation of the
     guaranty. It is found in the answer to the question whether,
     under the circumstances of the case, this country, endowed as it
     is with influence and power, would quietly stand by and witness
     the perpetration of the direst crime that ever stained the pages
     of history, and thus become participators in the sin.</p>

     <p>"If Belgium's independence goes, the independence of Holland will
     follow. I ask the House from the point of view of British
     interests to consider what may be at stake. If France is beaten
     in a struggle of life and death, loses her position as a great
     power, becomes subordinate to the will and power of one greater
     than herself&mdash;consequences which I do not anticipate, because I
     am sure that France has the power to defend herself with all the
     energy and ability and patriotism which she has shown so often,
     and if Belgium fell under the same dominating influence, and then
     Holland, and then Denmark, then would not Mr. Gladstone's words
     come true, that just opposite to us there would be a common
     interest against the unmeasured aggrandizement of any power?</p>

     <p>"It may be said, I suppose, that we might stand aside, husband
     our strength, and that, whatever happened in the course of this
     war, at the end of it to intervene with effect to put things
     right, and to adjust them to our own point of view. If, in a
     crisis like this, we run away from those obligations of honor and
     interest as regards the Belgian treaty, I doubt <span class="pagenum"><a id="page493" name="page493"></a>(p. 493)</span>
     whether, whatever material force we might have at the end, it
     would be of very much value in face of the respect that we should
     have lost. And do not believe, whether a great power stands
     outside this war or not, it is going to be in a position at the
     end of it to exert its superior strength. For us, with a powerful
     fleet, which we believe able to protect our commerce, to protect
     our shores, and to protect our interests, if we are engaged in
     war, we shall suffer but little more than we shall suffer even if
     we stand aside.</p>

     <p>"We are going to suffer terribly in this war, whether we are in
     it or whether we stand aside. Foreign trade is going to stop, not
     because the trade routes are closed, but because there is no
     trade at the other end. I do not believe for a moment that at the
     end of this war, even if we stood aside, we should be in a
     material position, to use our force decisively to undo what had
     happened in the course of the war, to prevent the whole of the
     west of Europe opposite to us falling under the domination of a
     single power, and I am quite sure that our moral position would
     be such as to have lost us all respect.</p>

     <p>"Mobilization of the fleet has taken place; mobilization of the
     army is taking place; but we have as yet taken no engagement with
     regard to sending an expeditionary armed force out of the
     country, because I feel that&mdash;in the case of a European
     conflagration such as this, unprecedented, with our enormous
     responsibilities in India and other parts of the Empire, or in
     countries in British occupation, with all the unknown factors&mdash;we
     must take the question very carefully into consideration, until
     we know how we stand.</p>

     <p>"What other policy is there before the House? There is but one
     way in which the Government could make certain at the present
     moment of keeping outside this war, and that would be that it
     should immediately issue a proclamation of unconditional
     neutrality. We cannot do that. We should sacrifice our good name
     and reputation before the world, and should not escape the most
     serious and grave economic consequences.</p>

     <p>"As far as the forces of the crown are concerned, we are ready. I
     believe the Prime Minister and the First Lord of the Admiralty
     [Winston Churchill] have no doubt whatever that the readiness and
     the efficiency of those forces were never at a higher mark than
     they are to-day, and never was there a time when confidence was
     more justified in the power of the navy to protect our commerce
     and to protect our shores.</p>

     <p>"The most awful responsibility is resting upon the Government in
     deciding what to advise the House of Commons to do. We have made
     clear to the House, I trust, that we are prepared to face that
     situation. We worked for peace up to the last moment, and beyond
     the last moment. We believe we shall have the support of the
     House at large in proceeding to whatever the consequences may be
     and whatever measures may be forced upon us. The country has not
     had time to realize the issue. It perhaps is still thinking of
     the quarrel between Austria and Serbia, and not the complications
     of this matter which have grown out of the quarrel between
     Austria and Serbia. Russia and Germany we know are at war. We do
     not yet know officially that Austria, the ally whom Germany is to
     support, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page494" name="page494"></a>(p. 494)</span> is yet at war with Russia. We know that a good
     deal has been happening on the French frontier.</p>

     <p>"I believe, when the country realizes what is at stake, what the
     real issues are, the magnitude of the impending dangers in the
     west of Europe, we shall be supported throughout, not only by the
     House of Commons, but by the determination, the resolution, the
     courage, and the endurance of the whole country."</p>
</div>

<p><i>France.</i> Minister Klobukowski telegraphed from Brussels the answer the
Belgian Government had given on the evening of August 2 to the German
ultimatum:</p>

     <p class="quote">"The information as to the French movements appeared to them to
     be inaccurate in view of the formal assurances which had been
     given by France, and were still quite recent; that Belgium, which
     since the establishment of her kingdom, has taken every care to
     assure the protection of her dignity and of her interests, and
     has devoted all her efforts to peaceful development of progress,
     strongly protests against any violation of her territory from
     whatever quarter it may come: and that, supposing the violation
     takes place, she will know how to defend with energy her
     neutrality, which has been guaranteed by the powers, and notably
     by the King of Prussia."</p>

<p>M. Klobukowski added in a supplementary telegram:</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"To the assurance which I gave him that if Belgium appealed to
     the guarantee of the powers against the violation of her
     neutrality by Germany, France would at once respond to her
     appeal, the Minister for Foreign Affairs [M. Davignon] answered:</p>

     <p>"It is with great sincerity that we thank the Government of the
     Republic for the support which it would eventually be able to
     offer us, but under present conditions we do not appeal to the
     guarantee of the powers. At a later date the Government of the
     king will weigh the measures which it may be necessary to take."</p>
</div>

<p>Ambassador Paul Cambon telegraphed from London:</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"Sir Edward Grey has authorized me to inform you that he was
     making explanations to the Commons as to the present attitude of
     the British Government, and that the chief of these declarations
     would be as follows:</p>

     <p>"'In case the German fleet came into the Channel or entered the
     North Sea in order to go round the British Isles with the object
     of attacking the French coasts or the French navy and of
     harassing French merchant shipping, the British fleet would
     intervene in order to give to French shipping its complete
     protection, in such a way that from that moment Great Britain and
     Germany would be in a state of war.'</p>

     <p>"Sir Edward Grey explained to me that the mention of an operation
     by way of the North Sea implied protection against a
     demonstration in the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

     <p>"The declaration concerning the intervention of the British fleet
     must be considered as binding the British Government. Sir Edward
     Grey has <span class="pagenum"><a id="page495" name="page495"></a>(p. 495)</span> assured me of this and has added that the
     French Government were thereby authorized to inform the Chambers
     of this."</p>
</div>

<p>M. Paul Cambon supplemented this by a telegram stating:</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"Just as Sir Edward Grey was starting this morning for the
     meeting of the Cabinet, my German colleague [Prince Lichnowsky]
     came to press him to say that the neutrality of Great Britain did
     not depend upon respecting Belgian neutrality. Sir Edward Grey
     refused all conversation on this matter.</p>

     <p>"The German Ambassador has sent to the press a <i>communiqué</i>
     saying that if Great Britain remained neutral Germany would give
     up all naval operations and would not make use of the Belgian
     coast as a <i>point d'appui</i>. My answer is that respecting the
     coast is not respecting the neutrality of the territory, and that
     the German ultimatum is already a violation of this neutrality."</p>
</div>

<p>Later M. Paul Cambon telegraphed:</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"Sir Edward Grey has made the statement regarding the
     intervention of the British fleet. He has explained, in
     considering the situation, what he proposed to do with regard to
     Belgian neutrality; and the reading of a letter from King Albert
     asking for the support of Great Britain has deeply stirred the
     House.</p>

     <p>"The House will this evening vote the credit which is asked for;
     from this moment its support is secured to the policy of the
     Government, and it follows public opinion which is declaring
     itself more and more in our favor."</p>
</div>

<p>M. Viviani warned M. Paul Cambon that the German Ambassador Schoen was
reported to have said at the Foreign Office that yesterday eighty French
officers in Prussian uniform had attempted to cross the German frontier
in twelve motor cars at Walbeck.</p>

     <p class="quote">"Be good enough urgently to contradict this news which is pure
     invention, and to draw the attention of the [British] Foreign
     Office to the German campaign of false news which is beginning."</p>

<p>German Ambassador von Schoen had a farewell audience at the Foreign
Office at 6.45 p. m., at which he handed M. Viviani a letter stating
that French military aviators had committed "flagrantly hostile acts" on
German territory, one throwing bombs on the railway near Karlsruhe and
Nuremberg, and had openly violated the neutrality of Belgium by flying
over Belgian territory.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"I am instructed, and I have the honor to inform your excellency,
     that in the presence of these acts of aggression the German
     Empire considers itself <span class="pagenum"><a id="page496" name="page496"></a>(p. 496)</span> in a state of war with France
     in consequence of the acts of this latter power.</p>

     <p>"At the same time I have the honor to bring to the knowledge of
     your excellency that the German authorities will detain French
     mercantile vessels in German ports, but they will release them
     if, within forty-eight hours, they are assured of complete
     reciprocity."</p>
</div>

<p>M. Viviani formally challenged as inaccurate the allegations of the
ambassador.</p>

<p>M. Viviani instructed Ambassador Jules Cambon at Berlin to ask for his
passports.</p>

     <p class="quote">"I request you at the same time to protest in writing against the
     violation of the neutrality of Luxemburg by German troops, of
     which notice has been given by the Prime Minister of Luxemburg;
     against the ultimatum addressed to the Belgian Government by the
     German Minister at Brussels to force upon them the violation of
     Belgian neutrality and to require of that country that she should
     facilitate military operations against France on Belgian
     territory; finally against the false allegation of an alleged
     projected invasion of these two countries by French armies, by
     which he has attempted to justify the state of war which he
     declares henceforth exists between Germany and France."</p>

<p>M. Allizé, Minister at Munich, was also instructed to ask for his
passports.</p>

<p>M. Viviani reported to the French representatives abroad that German
troops had violated Belgian territory at Gemmerich.</p>

<p><i>Belgium.</i> Baron von der Elst, Secretary General, reported an interview
at 1.30 p. m. with Herr von Below Saleske, German Minister.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"The minister officially informed the Belgian Government that
     French dirigibles had thrown bombs, and that a French cavalry
     patrol had crossed the frontier in violation of international
     law, seeing that war had not been declared.</p>

     <p>"The secretary general asked Herr von Below where these incidents
     had happened, and was told that it was in Germany. Baron van der
     Elst then observed that in that case he could not understand the
     object of this communication. Herr von Below stated that these
     acts, which were contrary to international law, were calculated
     to lead to the supposition that other acts, contrary to
     international law, would be committed by France."</p>
</div>

<p>M. Davignon, Minister for Foreign Affairs, communicated to Herr von
Below Saleske Belgium's reply to the German note.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"This note has made a deep and painful impression upon the
     Belgian Government.</p>

     <p>"The intentions attributed to France by Germany are in
     contradiction to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page497" name="page497"></a>(p. 497)</span> the formal declarations made to us on
     August 1, in the name of the French Government.</p>

     <p>"Moreover, if, contrary to our expectation, Belgian neutrality
     should be violated by France, Belgium intends to fulfill her
     international obligations and the Belgian army would offer the
     most vigorous resistance to the invader.</p>

     <p>"The treaties of 1839, confirmed by the treaties of 1870 vouch
     for the independence and neutrality of Belgium under the guaranty
     of the powers, and notably of the Government of his majesty the
     King of Prussia.</p>

     <p>"Belgium has always been faithful to her international
     obligations, she has carried out her duties in a spirit of loyal
     impartiality, and she has left nothing undone to maintain and
     enforce respect for her neutrality.</p>

     <p>"The attack upon her independence with which the German
     Government threaten her constitutes a flagrant violation of
     international law. No strategic interest justifies such a
     violation of law.</p>

     <p>"The Belgian Government, if they were to accept the proposals
     submitted to them, would sacrifice the honor of the nation and
     betray their duty toward Europe.</p>

     <p>"Conscious of the part which Belgium has played for more than
     eighty years in the civilization of the world, they refuse to
     believe that the independence of Belgium can only be preserved at
     the price of the violation of her neutrality.</p>

     <p>"If this hope is disappointed the Belgian Government are firmly
     resolved to repel, by all the means in their power, every attack
     upon their rights."</p>
</div>

<p>M. Davignon reported this action to the Ministers at St. Petersburg,
Berlin, London, Paris, Vienna, and The Hague. To the same
representatives, except the Minister at The Hague, he reported a
statement made to him by the French Minister at Brussels:</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"Although I have received no instructions to make a declaration
     from my Government, I feel justified, in view of their well-known
     intentions, in saying that if the Belgian Government were to
     appeal to the French Government as one of the powers guaranteeing
     their neutrality, the French Government would at once respond to
     Belgium's appeal; if such an appeal were not made it is probable,
     that&mdash;unless of course exceptional measures were rendered
     necessary in self-defence&mdash;the French Government would not
     intervene until Belgium had taken some effective measure of
     resistance.</p>

     <p>"I thanked M. Klobukowski for the support which the French
     Government had been good enough to offer us in case of need, and
     I informed him that the Belgian Government were making no appeal
     at present to the guaranty of the powers, and that they would
     decide later what ought to be done."</p>
</div>

<p>Count Lalaing, Minister at London, telegraphed to M. Davignon that Sir
Edward Grey, Secretary for Foreign Affairs, had informed him "that if
our neutrality is violated it means war with Germany."</p>


<h3><span class="pagenum"><a id="page498" name="page498"></a>(p. 498)</span> TUESDAY, AUGUST 4, 1914</h3>

<p><i>Serbia.</i> On the following day, August 4, 1914, M. Pashitch, Prime
Minister, recalled the legation and consulate from Germany.</p>

<p><i>Austria-Hungary.</i> Ambassador Mensdorff telegraphed from Berlin that
Great Britain had sent to Germany its ultimatum concerning Belgium, and
expected an answer to-night at twelve o'clock.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"Sir E. Grey said to me that at present there was no reason why
     he should make any communication to the Imperial and Royal
     Government, and there was no cause why a conflict should arise
     between us, so long as we were not in a condition of war with
     France. In any case, he hoped that we would not begin hostilities
     without the formality of a previous declaration of war. He does
     not intend to recall Sir M. de Bunsen.</p>

     <p>"Should we be at war with France, it would indeed be difficult
     for Great Britain, as the ally of France, to cooperate with her
     in the Atlantic, and not in the Mediterranean."</p>
</div>


<h4>VON BETHMANN-HOLLWEG EXPLAINS GERMANY'S POSITION IN THE REICHSTAG</h4>

<p><i>Germany.</i> Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg spoke before the Reichstag
(Imperial Parliament). The points of his address were as follows:</p>

<p>1. Germany has kept the peace and protected the peace of Europe for
forty-four years, yet, under the pretense that she was desirous of war,</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"enmity has been awakened against us in the East and the West and
     chains have been fashioned for us. The wind then sown has brought
     forth the whirlwind which has now broken loose. We wished to
     continue our work of peace, and, like a silent vow, the feeling
     that animated everyone from the emperor down to the youngest
     soldier was this: Only in defence of a just cause shall our sword
     fly from its scabbard.</p>

     <p>"The day has now come when we must draw it, against our wish, and
     in spite of our sincere endeavors. Russia has set fire to the
     building. We are at war with Russia and France&mdash;a war that has
     been forced upon us."</p>
</div>

<p>2. Germany has endeavored to localize the conflict between
Austria-Hungary and Serbia. All other European Governments (particularly
Great Britain) save one took the same attitude. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page499" name="page499"></a>(p. 499)</span> Russia alone
asserted that she had to be heard in a settlement of the matter.</p>

     <p class="quote">"Thus the danger of a European crisis raised its threatening
     head."</p>

<p>3. Russia began to mobilize. On this, Germany declared that Russian
military measures against Austria-Hungary would find her on the side of
her ally, and that she would take countermeasures, coming near to actual
war.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"Russia assured us in the most solemn manner of her desire for
     peace, and declared that she was making no military preparations
     against us.</p>

     <p>"In the meantime, Great Britain, warmly supported by us, tried to
     mediate between Vienna and St. Petersburg."</p>
</div>

<p>4. Kaiser William II telegraphed to Nicholas II asking for the Czar's
assistance in smoothing over difficulties between Russia and
Austria-Hungary. Before receipt of this telegram the Czar asked the
Kaiser to induce Austria-Hungary to aid him in inducing Vienna to
moderate her demands on Serbia. The Kaiser accepted the rôle of
mediator.</p>

<p>5. Germany influenced Austria-Hungary to resume the broken conversations
with Russia.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"But before the final decision was taken at Vienna, the news
     arrived that Russia had mobilized her entire forces and that her
     mobilization was therefore directed against us also. The Russian
     Government, who knew from our repeated statements what
     mobilization on our frontiers meant, did not notify us of this
     mobilization, nor did they even offer any explanation. It was not
     until the afternoon of July 31 that the emperor received a
     telegram from the czar in which he guaranteed that his army would
     not assume a provocative attitude toward us. But mobilization on
     our frontiers had been in full swing since the night of July
     30-31, and France, though indeed not actually mobilizing, was
     admittedly making military preparations.</p>

     <p>"What was our position? For the sake of the peace of Europe we
     had, up till then, deliberately refrained from calling up a
     single reservist. Were we now to wait further in patience until
     the nations on either side of us chose the moment for their
     attack? It would have been a crime to expose Germany to such
     peril. Therefore, on July 31, we called upon Russia to demobilize
     as the only measure which could still preserve the peace of
     Europe, and informed her that in case our demand met with a
     refusal, we should have to consider that a state of war existed.</p>

     <p>"No answer was given, and we mobilized our forces on August 1, at
     5 p. m."</p>
</div>

<p>6. France evaded our direct question as to whether she would remain
neutral in a Russo-German war.</p>

     <p class="quote"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page500" name="page500"></a>(p. 500)</span> "In spite of this, the kaiser ordered that the French
     frontier was to be unconditionally respected. This order, with
     one single exception<a id="footnotetag2" name="footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2" title="Go to footnote 2"><span class="smaller">[2]</span></a>, was strictly obeyed. France, who
     mobilized at the same time as we did, assured us that she would
     respect a zone of 10 kilometers on the frontier. What really
     happened? Aviators dropped bombs, and cavalry patrols and French
     infantry detachments appeared on the territory of the empire!
     Though war had not been declared, France thus broke the peace and
     actually attacked us."</p>

<p>After this recital the Chancellor entered upon his oration proper.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"Gentlemen, we are now in a state of necessity (<i>Notwehr</i>), and
     necessity (<i>Not</i>) knows no law. Our troops have occupied
     Luxemburg and perhaps have already entered Belgian territory.</p>

     <p>"Gentlemen, that is a breach of international law. It is true
     that the French Government declared at Brussels that France would
     respect Belgian neutrality as long as her adversary respected it.
     We knew, however, that France stood ready for an invasion. France
     could wait, we could not. A French attack on our flank on the
     lower Rhine might have been disastrous. Thus we were forced to
     ignore the rightful protests of the Governments of Luxemburg and
     Belgium. The wrong&mdash;I speak openly&mdash;the wrong we thereby commit
     we will try to make good as soon as our military aims have been
     attained.</p>

     <p>"He who is menaced as we are and is fighting for his highest
     possession can only consider how he is to hack his way through
     (<i>durchhauen</i>).</p>

     <p>"Gentlemen, we stand shoulder to shoulder with Austria-Hungary.</p>

     <p>"As for Great Britain's attitude, the statements made by Sir
     Edward Grey in the House of Commons yesterday show the standpoint
     assumed by the British Government. We have informed the British
     Government that, as long as Great Britain remains neutral, our
     fleet will not attack the northern coast of France, and that we
     will not violate the territorial integrity and independence of
     Belgium. These assurances I now repeat before the world, and I
     may add that, as long as Great Britain remains neutral, we would
     also be willing, upon reciprocity being assured, to take no
     warlike measures against French commercial shipping.</p>

     <p>"Gentlemen, so much for the facts. I repeat the words of the
     emperor: 'With a clear conscience we enter the lists.' We are
     fighting for the fruits of our works of peace, for the
     inheritance of a great past and for our future. The fifty years
     are not yet past during which Count Moltke said we should have to
     remain armed to defend the inheritance that we won in 1870. Now
     the great hour of trial has struck for our people. But with clear
     confidence we go forward to meet it. Our army is in the field,
     our navy is ready for battle&mdash;behind them stands the entire
     German nation&mdash;the entire German nation united to the last man.</p>

     <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page501" name="page501"></a>(p. 501)</span> "Gentlemen, you know your duty and all that it means.
     The proposed laws need no further explanation. I ask you to pass
     them quickly."</p>
</div>

<p>Secretary of State von Jagow telegraphed Ambassador Lichnowsky at
London:</p>

     <p class="quote">"Please dispel any mistrust that may subsist on the part of the
     British Government with regard to our intentions, by repeating
     most positively formal assurance that, even in the case of armed
     conflict with Belgium, Germany will, under no pretence whatever,
     annex Belgian territory. Sincerity of this declaration is borne
     out by the fact that we solemnly pledged our word to Holland
     strictly to respect her neutrality. It is obvious that we could
     not profitably annex Belgian territory without making at the same
     time territorial acquisitions at expense of Holland. Please
     impress upon Sir E. Grey that the German army could not be
     exposed to French attack across Belgium, which was planned
     according to absolutely unimpeachable information. Germany had
     consequently to disregard Belgian neutrality, it being for her a
     question of life or death to prevent French advance."</p>

<p><i>Great Britain.</i> Sir Edward Grey, Secretary for Foreign Affairs,
telegraphed Ambassador Goschen at Berlin to protest to the German
Government against its violation of the treaty safeguarding Belgian
neutrality, and to request an immediate assurance that the demand made
upon Belgium would not be proceeded with.</p>

<p>Ambassador Villiers telegraphed from Brussels that the German Minister,
Von Below Saleske, had addressed a note to M. Davignon, Minister for
Foreign Affairs,</p>

     <p class="quote">"stating that as Belgian Government have declined the
     well-intentioned proposals submitted to them by the Imperial
     Government, the latter will, deeply to their regret, be compelled
     to carry out, if necessary by force of arms, the measures
     considered indispensable in view of the French menaces."</p>

<p>Sir Edward Grey telegraphed back that Great Britain expected the Belgian
Government to resist by any means in their power Germany's invasion of
their neutrality, and that the British Government were prepared to join
Russia and France in common action to resist the German action and to
guarantee to maintain Belgian independence and integrity in future
years.</p>

<p>Grey protested, through Ambassador Goschen, to the German Government
against the continued detention of British merchant ships at Hamburg and
other German ports, as in direct contravention <span class="pagenum"><a id="page502" name="page502"></a>(p. 502)</span> of
international law and of the assurances given by Chancellor von
Bethmann-Hollweg.</p>

<p>Villiers telegraphed from Brussels:</p>

     <p class="quote">"German troops have entered Belgian territory, and Liege has been
     summoned to surrender by small party of Germans who, however,
     were repulsed."</p>

<p>Grey, on the basis of this information, telegraphed Ambassador Goschen
to ask the German Government that a satisfactory answer to his morning
telegram be received in London by twelve o'clock at night.</p>

     <p class="quote">"If not, you are instructed to ask for your passports, and to say
     that his majesty's Government feel bound to take all steps in
     their power to uphold the neutrality of Belgium and the
     observance of a treaty to which Germany is as much a party as
     ourselves."</p>

<p>As reported to Sir Edward Grey on August 8, after his return to London,
Sir Edward Goschen, Ambassador at Berlin, had an interview with Herr von
Jagow on this same day, August 4.</p>


<h4>SIR EDWARD GOSCHEN'S INTERVIEW WITH VON JAGOW</h4>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"In accordance with your instructions of the 4th inst., I called
     upon the Secretary of State that afternoon and inquired, in the
     name of his majesty's Government, whether the Imperial Government
     would refrain from violating Belgian neutrality. Herr von Jagow
     at once replied that he was sorry to say that his answer must be
     'No,' as, in consequence of the German troops having crossed the
     frontier that morning, Belgian neutrality had been already
     violated. He again went into the reasons why the Imperial
     Government had been obliged to take this step, namely, that they
     had to advance into France by the quickest and easiest way, so as
     to be able to get well ahead with their operations and endeavor
     to strike some decisive blow as early as possible. It was a
     matter of life and death for them, as if they had gone by the
     more southern route they could not have hoped, in view of the
     paucity of roads and the strength of the fortresses, to have got
     through without formidable opposition entailing great loss of
     time. This loss of time would have meant time gained by the
     Russians for bringing up their troops to the German frontier.
     Rapidity of action was the great German asset, while that of
     Russia was an inexhaustible supply of troops. I pointed out to
     Herr von Jagow that this <i>fait accompli</i> of the violation of the
     Belgian frontier rendered, as he would readily understand, the
     situation exceedingly grave, and I asked him whether there was
     not still time to draw back and avoid possible consequences,
     which both he <span class="pagenum"><a id="page503" name="page503"></a>(p. 503)</span> and I would deplore. He replied that, for
     the reasons he had given me, it was now impossible for them to
     draw back.</p>

     <p>"During the afternoon I received your further telegram of the
     same date and, in compliance with the instructions therein
     contained, I again proceeded to the Imperial Foreign Office and
     informed the Secretary of State that, unless the Imperial
     Government could give the assurance by twelve o'clock that night
     that they would proceed no further with their violation of the
     Belgian frontier and stop their advance, I had been instructed to
     demand my passports and inform the Imperial Government that his
     majesty's Government would have to take all steps in their power
     to uphold the neutrality of Belgium and the observance of a
     treaty to which Germany was as much a party as themselves.</p>

     <p>"Herr von Jagow replied that to his great regret he could give no
     other answer than that which he had given me earlier in the day,
     namely, that the safety of the empire rendered it absolutely
     necessary that the Imperial troops should advance through
     Belgium. I asked him whether, in view of the terrible
     consequences which would necessarily ensue, it were not possible
     even at the last moment that their answer should be reconsidered.
     He replied that if the time given were even twenty-four hours or
     more, his answer must be the same. I said that in that case I
     should have to demand my passports. This interview took place at
     about seven o'clock. In a short conversation which ensued Herr
     von Jagow expressed his poignant regret at the crumbling of his
     entire policy and that of the chancellor, which had been to make
     friends with Great Britain, and then, through Great Britain, to
     get closer to France. I said that this sudden end to my work in
     Berlin was to me also a matter of deep regret and disappointment,
     but that he must understand that under the circumstances and in
     view of our engagements, his majesty's Government could not
     possibly have acted otherwise than they had done.</p>

     <p>"I then said that I should like to go and see the chancellor, as
     it might be, perhaps, the last time I should have an opportunity
     of seeing him. He begged me to do so. I found the chancellor very
     agitated. His excellency at once began a harangue, which lasted
     for about twenty minutes. He said that the step taken by his
     majesty's Government was terrible to a degree; just for a
     word&mdash;'neutrality,' a word which in war time had so often been
     disregarded&mdash;just for a scrap of paper Great Britain was going to
     make war on a kindred nation who desired nothing better than to
     be friends with her. All his efforts in that direction had been
     rendered useless by this last terrible step, and the policy to
     which, as I knew, he had devoted himself since his accession to
     office had tumbled down like a house of cards. What we had done
     was unthinkable; it was like striking a man from behind while he
     was fighting for his life against two assailants. He held Great
     Britain responsible for all the terrible events that might
     happen. I protested strongly against that statement, and said
     that, in the same way as he and Herr von Jagow wished me to
     understand that for strategical reasons it was a matter of life
     and death to Germany to advance through Belgium and violate the
     latter's neutrality, so I would wish him to understand that it
     was, so to speak, a matter of 'life and death' for the honor of
     Great Britain that <span class="pagenum"><a id="page504" name="page504"></a>(p. 504)</span> she should keep her solemn
     engagement to do her utmost to defend Belgium's neutrality if
     attacked. That solemn compact simply had to be kept, or what
     confidence could anyone have in engagements given by Great
     Britain in the future? The chancellor said: 'But at what price
     will that compact have been kept. Has the British Government
     thought of that?' I hinted to his excellency as plainly as I
     could that fear of consequences could hardly be regarded as an
     excuse for breaking solemn engagements, but his excellency was so
     excited, so evidently overcome by the news of our action, and so
     little disposed to hear reason that I refrained from adding fuel
     to the flame by further argument. As I was leaving he said that
     the blow of Great Britain joining Germany's enemies was all the
     greater that almost up to the last moment he and his Government
     had been working with us and supporting our efforts to maintain
     peace between Austria and Russia. I said that this was part of
     the tragedy which saw the two nations fall apart just at the
     moment when the relations between them had been more friendly and
     cordial than they had been for years. Unfortunately,
     notwithstanding our efforts to maintain peace between Russia and
     Austria, the war had spread and had brought us face to face with
     a situation which, if we held to our engagements, we could not
     possibly avoid, and which unfortunately entailed our separation
     from our late fellow-workers. He would readily understand that no
     one regretted this more than I.</p>

     <p>"After this somewhat painful interview I returned to the embassy
     and drew up a telegraphic report of what had passed. This
     telegram was handed in at the Central Telegraph Office a little
     before 9 p. m. It was apparently never dispatched."<a id="footnotetag3" name="footnotetag3"></a><a href="#footnote3" title="Go to footnote 3"><span class="smaller">[3]</span></a></p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Goschen's report went on to relate the attack that evening on the
British Embassy by a mob excited by the report in a flying sheet of the
"Berliner Tageblatt" that Great Britain had declared war on Germany. The
German Government repudiated the report and did all it could, by the
personal apology of the secretary of state and by police protection, to
make amends for what Herr von Jagow termed "the indelible stain on the
reputation of Berlin."</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"On the following morning, August 5, the emperor sent one of his
     majesty's aides-de-camp to me with the following message:</p>

     <p>"'The emperor has charged me to express to your excellency his
     regret for the occurrences of last night, but to tell you at the
     same time that you will gather from those occurrences an idea of
     the feelings of his people respecting the action of Great Britain
     in joining with other nations against her old Allies of Waterloo.
     His majesty also begs that you will tell the king that he has
     been proud of the titles of British field marshal and British
     admiral, but that in consequence of what has occurred he must now
     at once divest himself of those titles.'</p>

     <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page505" name="page505"></a>(p. 505)</span> "I would add that the above message lost none of its
     acerbity by the manner of its delivery."</p>
</div>

<p>At 11 a. m., August 5, Ambassador Goschen received his passports. He
returned to London on the following day without molestation from the
crowd, although this could not be said of the departure of the French
and Russian Ambassadors. He closed his report with a compliment to the
American Ambassador, Mr. Gerard, for assistance rendered by him in these
trying times.</p>

<p><i>France.</i> A message from President Poincaré was read at a extraordinary
session of Parliament, the members of which remained standing during the
reading. This announced the "violent and premeditated" attack on France
by Germany in "insolent defiance of the law of nations" being delivered
before any declaration of war, and asking for passports by the German
Ambassador at Paris. The president recounted the pacific course of
Frenchmen in "burying at the bottom of their heart the desire for
legitimate reparation, of the wrong done their country by Germany in
1871, and in using their rejuvenated strength in the interest of
progress and for the good of humanity." In particular he spoke of the
efforts France had made for peace since Austria's ultimatum to Serbia.
He solemnly declared</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"that France had made up to the last moment supreme efforts to
     avert the war now about to break out, the crushing responsibility
     for which the German Empire will have to bear before history.
     (<i>Unanimous and repeated applause.</i>)</p>

     <p>"On the very morrow of the day when we and our allies were
     publicly expressing our hope of seeing negotiations which had
     been begun under the auspices of the London Cabinet carried to a
     peaceful conclusion Germany suddenly declared war upon Russia;
     she has invaded the territory of Luxemburg; she has outrageously
     insulted the noble Belgian nation (<i>loud applause</i>), our neighbor
     and our friend, and attempted treacherously to fall upon us while
     we were in the midst of diplomatic conversation. (<i>Fresh and
     repeated applause.</i>)</p>

     <p>"But France was watching. As alert as she was peaceful, she was
     prepared; and our enemies will meet on their path our valiant
     covering troops, who are at their post and will provide the
     screen behind which the mobilization of our national forces will
     be methodically completed....</p>

     <p>"In the war which is beginning France will have right on her
     side, the eternal power of which cannot with impunity be
     disregarded by nations any more than by individuals. (<i>Loud
     applause.</i>)</p>

     <p>"She will be heroically defended by all her sons; nothing will
     break their sacred union before the enemy; to-day they are joined
     together as brothers <span class="pagenum"><a id="page506" name="page506"></a>(p. 506)</span> in a common indignation against
     the aggressor, and in a common patriotic faith. (<i>Loud and
     prolonged applause and cries of 'Vive la France.'</i>)</p>

     <p>"She is faithfully helped by Russia, her ally (<i>loud applause</i>);
     she is supported by the loyal friendship of Great Britain. (<i>Loud
     applause.</i>)</p>

     <p>"And already from every part of the civilized world sympathy and
     good wishes are coming to her. For to-day once again she stands
     before the universe for liberty, justice, and reason (<i>loud and
     repeated applause</i>) 'Haut les c&oelig;urs et vive la France!'<a id="footnotetag4" name="footnotetag4"></a><a href="#footnote4" title="Go to footnote 4"><span class="smaller">[4]</span></a>
     (<i>Prolonged applause.</i>)"</p>
</div>

<p>M. Viviani, the Prime Minister, spoke before the Chamber of Deputies. He
recounted those actions of Germany in relation to the Austro-Serbian
crisis on which the light of subsequent events cast a sinister
interpretation. He gave the fabricated complaints against France for
violating German territory presented by Ambassador von Schoen plainly to
offset the true charges made by France of German violation of French
territory, and declared:</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"At no time has any French aviator penetrated into Belgium, nor
     has any French aviator committed either in Bavaria or any other
     part of Germany any hostile act. The opinion of Europe has
     already done justice to these wretched inventions. (<i>Loud
     applause.</i>)</p>

     <p>"Against these attacks, which violate all the laws of justice and
     all the principles of public law, we have now taken all the
     necessary steps; they are being carried out strictly, regularly,
     and with calmness.</p>

     <p>"The mobilization of the Russian army also continues with
     remarkable vigor and unrestrained enthusiasm. (<i>Prolonged
     applause, all the deputies rising from their seats.</i>) The Belgian
     army, mobilized with 250,000 men, prepares with a splendid
     passion and magnificent ardor to defend the neutrality and
     independence of their country. (<i>Renewed applause.</i>)</p>

     <p>"The entire British fleet is mobilized and orders have been given
     to mobilize the land forces. (<i>Loud cheers, all the deputies
     rising to their feet.</i>)"</p>
</div>

<p><i>Belgium.</i> Baron Fallon, Belgian Minister at The Hague, reported to M.
Davignon, Minister for Foreign Affairs at Brussels, that Holland
intended to institute war buoying on the Scheldt (Dutch river leading to
Antwerp in Belgium). The river would be closed at night only, and
navigation by day would be under Dutch pilots. Belgian lightships must
be withdrawn from Dutch territory to facilitate maintenance of its
neutrality.</p>

<p>M. Davignon presented passports to German Minister von Below Saleske.
The minister intrusted the custody of the German Legation to the
American Minister, Brand Whitlock. The <span class="pagenum"><a id="page507" name="page507"></a>(p. 507)</span> Belgian Minister, Baron
Beyens, at Berlin, asked for his passports. Before leaving he
telegraphed a report of the German Chancellor's speech to the Reichstag
on the "infamous" violation of Belgian neutrality.</p>

     <p class="quote">"It is noteworthy that Herr von Bethmann-Hollweg recognizes
     without the slightest disguise, that Germany is violating
     international law by her invasion of Belgian territory, and that
     she is committing a wrong against us."</p>

<p>Count de Lalaing, Minister at London, telegraphed that Sir Edward Grey,
Secretary for Foreign Affairs, had informed the British Ministers in
Norway, Holland, and Belgium</p>

     <p class="quote">"that Great Britain expects that these three kingdoms will resist
     German pressure and observe neutrality. Should they resist they
     will have the support of Great Britain, who is ready in that
     event, should the three above-mentioned Governments desire it, to
     join France and Russia in offering an alliance to the said
     Governments for the purpose of resisting the use of force by
     Germany against them, and a guaranty to maintain the future
     independence and integrity of the three kingdoms. I observed to
     him that Belgium was neutral in perpetuity. The Minister for
     Foreign Affairs answered: This is in case her neutrality is
     violated."</p>

<p>M. Davignon reported to the ministers at Paris, London, and St.
Petersburg all the important diplomatic happenings respecting Belgium
from July 31 to the appeal to the powers to guarantee Belgian
neutrality, which was under present deliberation.</p>

<p>M. Davignon appealed to Great Britain, France, and Russia to cooperate
as guarantors of her territory and independence, and to employ concerted
action to resist by force German violation of the same, and at the same
time</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"to guarantee the future maintenance of the independence and
     integrity of Belgium.</p>

     <p>"Belgium is happy to be able to declare that she will undertake
     the defense of her fortified places."</p>
</div>

<p>King Albert made an address to the Belgian Parliament which closed as
follows:</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"The army is equal to its task. The Government and myself have
     full confidence. The Government understands its responsibilities
     and will maintain them till the end to safeguard the supreme good
     of the country. If the stranger violates our territory he will
     find all Belgians gathered round their sovereign, who will never
     betray his constitutional oath.</p>

     <p>"I have faith in our destinies. A country which defends itself
     imposes respect on all and does not perish. God will be with us."</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page508" name="page508"></a>(p. 508)</span> War was now on between Russia, France, Great Britain and
Belgium on the one side, and Germany, soon and certainly to be joined by
Austria-Hungary, on the other. While the diplomatic controversy
continued, it was over minor subjects, such as what understanding, if
any, had existed before the war between Great Britain and Belgium with
reference to the former landing an expeditionary force on the soil of
the latter in event of hostilities with Germany. By August 5, 1914, all
the main evidence which the belligerent powers chose to present was
before the court of the world's opinion. It has here been given in as
full a form as the exigency of space has permitted, and in that
impartial manner which a strict observance of editorial ethics insures.
The editor has refrained from cross-references indicating a conflict of
evidence, since this could not be made without exercising a judicial
function into which biased opinion might creep. It will be easy for the
reader to make these comparisons for himself, because of the listing of
the correspondence by countries and dates. A careful study of the data
